documentation web site for cloudify 3.4.0

* 3.4.0-build [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/cloudify-cosmo/docs.getcloudify.org/tree/3.4.0-build.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/cloudify-cosmo/docs.getcloudify.org/tree/3.4.0-build)

IMPORTANT! - We are using Hugo 0.14! Otherwise it won't work.


how to contribute?
===================


to run this project you need to make sure the following is installed:
 - [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) - version 0.10 and above is fine
 - [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) - `sudo npm install -g grunt-cli`
 - [bower](http://bower.io/) - `sudo npm install -g bower`
 - [gohugo](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/releases) - version 0.14!
 - clone this repository (the content repository)
 - clone [docs.getcloudify.org-site repository](https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/docs.getcloudify.org-site) (the framework around the content)


now do the following steps:
 - create a configuration file under `docs.getcloudify.org-site/dev/config.json`
   - alternatively, you can write the file wherever you want and export CONFIG_JSON variable that will point to its location
 - go to root of `docs.getcloudify.org-site` and run:
   - `bower cache clean && bower install`
   - `sudo npm cache clean && npm install` (first command as sudo and second not)

the config file looks like this:

```
{
    "content" :
    {
        "root" : "/full/path/to/content/clone/root/folder"
    }
}
```


and you're done. these things should be done only on the first time you setup your environment.

from time to time, you might need to run the `bower` and `npm` commands again in case the framework has changed.
if you get errors in the next step, running these commands and try again.

now, to start writing documentation, every time you will need to
 - go to `docs.getcloudify.org-site` clone and run `grunt server`

from now on, you work on the `docs.getcloudify.org` clone and push/pull changes from there. the framework will auto-sync

staging
=======

any feature branches, i.e. any branch whose name doesn't correspond to a version build (e.g. 3.3.1-build), are automatically staged online when they're pushed.

this lets you preview and share your changes before publishing them in the official public documentation.

your staging website is available at http://stage-docs.getcloudify.org/your-branch-name

don't worry about cluttering - stage websites are automatically removed after 21 days.

publishing
==========

official documentation is published through the master branch and version build branches (e.g. 3.3.1-build).

the master branch is published to http://docs.getcloudify.org/dev/, which represents the latest (unstable) build

version build branches are published to http://docs.getcloudify.org/version, e.g. 3.3.1-build becomes http://docs.getcloudify.org/3.3.1/

content organization
====================

* the pages are now divided to directories (e.g. 'plugins', 'intro'), where each directory represents a section on the site's left sidebar. Once a file is within a directory, it's automatically listed under the corresponding section

* the order of pages in a section is determined by the 'weight' parameter, which is stored in each page metadata (Front Matter.) Remember, lower weight == higher priority

* If there's a page you don't want to publish online, you can set ```'draft: true'``` in the page metadata

* To add a new section (directory,) you have to add it to the sidebar menu in the site project's config.toml.
  Currently, this is a site-wide file located at the docs.getcloudify.org-site repo, and cannot be configured per version.

cheat sheet
===========

A reference page is available for various content utilities at [cheatsheet.md](content/cheatsheet.md)

However, this page is unpublished and only available in development mode

For your convenience, some of the utilities are also described below.

page fields
===========

You can add custom fields to the page metadata and use these fields within the page.

Example:

page metadata (Front Matter):
```yaml
---
title: my page

favorite_food: icecream
---
```

page content:
```markdown
I love {{< field "favorite_food" >}}!
```


how to add a hyperlink
==============================

To add a link on a markdown page:

```markdown
[some text]({{< relref "path/to/page.md" >}})
```
where path/to/page.md is relative to the /content/ dir

how to add an image
===================

* copy the image to /static/images/some/path/img.png
* on the markdown page:
```markdown
![some alt text]({{< img "some/path/img.png" >}})
```

Link to latest 
==============
To create a link that will always direct to the latest version of the docs use 'latest/' syntax:
```
[I'm a link](http://docs.getcloudify.org/latest/intro/what-is-cloudify)
or
[I'm a link](/latest/intro/what-is-cloudify)
```
Will direct to `http://docs.getcloudify.org/LATEST_VERSION_NUMBER/intro/what-is-cloudify` where `LATEST_VERSION_NUMBER` is currently 3.3.1 .
