The `cfy use` command is used to control a specific manager.

Many of the commands in `cfy` (e.g. `cfy blueprints`, `cfy agents`) are used to perform actions on or using a Cloudify manager. To be able to perform those actions you must `cfy bootstrap` a manager and then `use` it. Note that after bootstrapping a manager, you will automatically `use` it. If you want to control another manager, you will have to use the `use` command.

After bootstrapping a manager, the user and ssh-key provided to use it will be used to perform ssh related commands (e.g. `cfy logs`, `cfy ssh`) are saved on the machine which performed the bootstrap process. Running `cfy use` to control another manager will remove those settings and will NOT set the user and ssh-key to the manager you ran `cfy use` on.

Usage: `cfy use [OPTIONS] MANAGER_IP`

Control a specific manager

`MANAGEMENT_IP` is the IP of the manager to use.

Additional CLI commands will be added after a manager is used. To stop
using a manager, you can run `cfy init -r`.
