The Cloudify command-line interface (CLI) is the default method for interacting with the Cloudify management environment, to manage your applications. It enables you to execute workflows on your local machine, and to interact with a running [Cloudify Manager]({{< relref "install_maintain/installation/installing-manager.md" >}}) via SSH to upload and delete blueprints, create deployments, execute workflows, retrieve events, and more.

Working _locally_ refers to running workflows directly from the machine on which the CLI is installed. Working with an instance of Cloudify Manager refers to executing workflows directly from that Cloudify Manager instance.

When you use the CLI to control a Cloudify Manager instance, additional commands appear in the CLI that are not available for use in local mode, for example communicating with a running Cloudify Manager using SSH, downloading its logs, creating snapshots, uploading plugins and so on.

{{% note title="Note" %}}

If you attempt to run a command that is not supported in local mode, an error message is returned advising you that the command is only supported when using Cloudify Manager. To use a Cloudify Manager, you can run [`cfy profiles use`]({{< relref "cli/maint_cli/profiles.md" >}}).

If you haven't already [installed Cloudify]({{< relref "install_maintain/installation/installing-cli.md" >}}), now would be a good time to do so.

# Usage

You can access the CLI by running the `cfy` command in your terminal. Use `cfy -h` to display a list of all the commands and their descriptions.

{{< highlight  bash  >}}
$ cfy -h
Usage: cfy [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Cloudify's Command Line Interface

  Note that some commands are only available if you are using a Manager. You
  can use Cloudify Manager by running the `cfy profiles use` command and providing
  it with the IP of the your manager (and SSH credentials if applicable).

  To activate bash-completion, run `eval "$(_CFY_COMPLETE=source cfy)"`

  Cloudify's working directory resides in ~/.cloudify. To change it, set the
  variable `CFY_WORKDIR` to the appropriate directory (e.g. /tmp/).

Options:
  -v, --verbose  Show verbose output. You can supply this up to three times
                 (i.e. -vvv)
  --version      Display the version and exit (if a manager is used, its
                 version will also show)
  -h, --help     Show this message and exit.

  agents            Handle a deployment's agents

Note that some features. such as viewing metric graphs and application topologies, are only available via the Web interface if you are running Cloudify Manager.

# Verbose Output

The ``-v/--verbose`` flag is available for all commands. It sets the command verbosity level. There are four verbosity levels:

* Running a command without the verbose flag. (The default).
* Running a command with ``-v`` prints tracebacks where relevant, in addition to the normal output.
* Running a command with ``-vv`` in addition to the tracebacks, displays the ``DEBUG`` log statements of local/remote execution events.
* Running a command with ``-vvv`` in addition to the tracebacks and debug log statements, sets all loggers declared in the `config <https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-cli/blob/3.4/cloudify_cli/resources/config.yaml>`_ file to debug mode.

{{% note title="Note" %}}
``--debug`` is equivalent to ``-vvv``

# Inputs and Parameters

For commands that accept inputs or parameters (for example, `cfy executions start` or `cfy deployments create`) the value must represent a dictionary. Valid formats are:

 * A path to the YAML file
 * A path to a directory containing one or more YAML files
 * A wildcard-based path to one or more YAML files
 * A string in JSON format
 * A string formatted as "key1=value1;key2=value2"

{{% note title="Note" %}}
You cannot pass non-string values when using the `key=value` method.

# Configuration

By default, a `.cloudify` directory is created under ~(Home directory). You can change the location using an `_env_` variable (for example, `cfy init` or `cfy profiles use`). 

The directory contains a file named `config.yaml` that you can customize according to your preferences. 

## Configurable Parameters

You can configure the parameters described in this section.

**Colored Output**

Enables colored output of different `cfy` commands:

{{< highlight  bash  >}}
colors: true
{{< /highlight >}}

The default value is `false`.

**Logging**

Specifies the path of the log file that `cfy` writes to:

{{< highlight  bash  >}}
logging:
  filename: /some/custom/path/to/a.log
{{< /highlight >}}

The default value is `$TMPDIR/cloudify-$USERNAME/cloudify.log`.

Configure specific python logger levels:

{{< highlight  bash  >}}
logging:
  loggers:
    cloudify.rest_client.http: debug
    some.external.package: debug
{{< /highlight >}}

The default sets the `cloudify.cli.main` and `cloudify.rest_client.http` loggers' logging level to `info`.

{{% note title="Note" %}}

The `.cloudify` directory might also contain other files and directories, which are used internally by `cfy`, that are not described in this section.
