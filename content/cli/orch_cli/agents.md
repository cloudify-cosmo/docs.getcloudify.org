The `cfy agents` command is used to manage Cloudify agents on existing deployments.

See [agents]({{< relref "install_maintain/agents/_index.md" >}}) for more information.


## Commands
### Common agents arguments

* `-d, --deployment-id TEXT` - The unique identifier for the deployment
* `--node-id TEXT` - The node id to filter to be used for filtering
* `--node-instance-id TEXT` - The node instance id to be used for filtering
* `--install-method TEXT` - Only show agents installed with this
                            install_method

The filtering flags can be passed multiple times or take comma separated values.

### list

List agents configured with the Manager.
When preparing to upgrade agents, if using the filtering options with `cfy agents install`,
use `cfy agents list` first with the same filtering options to verify which agents
are going to be installed.

#### Usage
`cfy agents list [OPTIONS]`

This command supports the [common agent flags]({{< relref "#common-agents-flags" >}})
and the [common CLI flags]({{< relref "cli/_index.md#common-options" >}}).


### install
After restoring a manager on a new host using a snapshot, this command installs new agents on the hosts for the new manager while also leaving the previous agents installed and running.

{{% warning title="Warning" %}}
This should only be used in very specific circumstances and should not be used to install agents for deployments using an existing manager. Instead, `cfy agents install` is to be used for upgrading the agents after the corresponding Manager upgrade.
