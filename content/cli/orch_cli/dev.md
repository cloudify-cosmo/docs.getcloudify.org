The `cfy dev` command is used to run [fabric](http://www.fabfile.org/) tasks on a Cloudify manager via SSH.

This supplies an easy way to run personalized, complex ssh scripts on the manager without having to manually connect to it.

{{% note title="Note" %}}
The tasks do not have to be decorated with the ``@task`` decorator, because they are directly called from the CLI code, as with any other python function. Also, as fabric is one of the CLI's dependencies, you do not need to install it separately unless you are using the CLI as a binary, in which case you must install fabric yourself.

For example, you could write a task that deploys and upgrades a monitoring agent you use to monitor your systems. During that manager's lifecycle, you could rerun the same task to update that agent.

#### Usage 
`cfy dev [options] -p TASKS_FILE -t TASK`

Run fabric tasks on the manager.

#### Required flags

*  `-t, --task=TASK` -  The name of fabric task to run
*  `-p, --tasks-file=TASKS_FILE` - 
                        The path to the tasks file

#### Optional flags

*  `-a ..., --args ...` -    Arguments for the fabric task


## Examples

{{< highlight  bash  >}}
$ cfy dev --tasks-file my_tasks.py -v -t my_task -a --arg1=something --arg2=otherthing ...
$ cfy dev -v -t my_task -a arg1_value arg2_value ...
...
{{< /highlight >}}

``--tasks-file my_tasks.py`` can be omitted if a ``tasks.py`` file exists in your current working directory.

For example, to echo ``something`` in your currently running Manager, you need only supply a ``tasks.py`` file with the following:

{{< highlight  python  >}}
from fabric.api import run

def echo(text):
  run('echo {0}'.format(text))
{{< /highlight >}}

{{< highlight  markdown  >}}
$ cfy dev -t echo -a something
{{< /highlight >}}

Cloudify provides a tasks [repository](https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-cli-fabric-tasks) from which users can obtain tasks and to which developers should contribute for the benefit of all.
