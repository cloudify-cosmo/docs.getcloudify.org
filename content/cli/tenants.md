The `cfy tenants` command is used to create and manage tenants on Cloudify Manager.<br>
You can run commands on a tenant other than the one that you are logged into by specifying the name of the tenant to which the command applies. For example, `cfy tenants add-user USERNAME -t TENANTNAME` can be used to add a user on a different tenant.

#### Requirements

* To use the command you must have Cloudify `admin` credentials.<br>
* Tenant names must conform to the following requirements:  

  * Minimum number of characters - 5
  * Maximum number of characters - 255
  * Valid characters are alphanumeric, or `-`, `_`, or `.`.
  * Value must begin with a letter
  * Cannot be empty
