The `cfy agents` command is used to install Cloudify agents on existing deployments.

After restoring a manager on a new host using a snapshot, this command installs new agents on the hosts for the new manager while also leaving the previous agents installed and running.

{{% gsWarning title="Warning" %}}
This should only be used in very specific circumstances and should not be used in the following situations:

* The same manager is upgraded using the `cfy upgrade` command.
* To install agents for deployments using an existing manager.
