Cloudify's Command-Line Interface is the default method for interacting with Cloudify and managing your applications. It allows you to execute workflows on your local machine as well as interact with a running [Cloudify Manager]({{< relref "manager/getting-started.md" >}}) (to ssh into a running Manager, upload blueprints, delete them, create deployments, execute workflows, retrieve events and more).

If you haven't already [installed Cloudify]({{< relref "installation/from-packages.md" >}}), now would be a good time to do so.

# Usage

The interface can be accessed by running the `cfy` command in your terminal. `cfy -h` will get you started:

{{< gsHighlight  markdown  >}}
$ cfy -h
usage: cfy [-h] [--version]                       ...

Note that some features (such as viewing metric graphs and application topologies) are only available via the Web UI if running Cloudify manager.


# Verbose Output

The ``-v/--verbose`` flag is available for all commands. It sets the command verbosity level. At the moment, there are 4 verbosity levels:

* Running a command without the verbose flag. (This is obviously the default).
* Running a command with ``-v`` will print tracebacks where relevant, in addition to the normal output.
* Running a command with ``-vv`` will, in addition, show ``DEBUG`` log statements of local/remote execution events.
* Running a command with ``-vvv`` will, in addition, set all loggers declared in the `config <https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-cli/blob/3.4/cloudify_cli/resources/config.yaml>`_ file to debug mode.

{{% gsNote title="Note" %}}
``--debug`` is equivalent to ``-vvv``

# Inputs and Parameters

All commands that accept inputs or parameters (e.g. `cfy executions start` or `cfy deployments create`) expect the value to represent a dictionary. Valid formats are:

 * A path to the YAML file
 * A path to a directory containing one or more YAML files
 * A wildcard based path to one or more YAML files
 * A string formatted as JSON
 * A string formatted as "key1=value1;key2=value2"

{{% gsNote title="Note" %}}
Using the `key=value` method, you cannot currently pass non-string values

# Configuration

A directory named `.cloudify` is created in the directory where `cfy` was initialized (e.g. by `cfy init` or `cfy use`). 

This directory contains a file named `config.yaml` which may be customized according to user preferences. What follows is details 
regarding the different configurable parameters.

## Colored Output

Enable colored output of different `cfy` commands:

```
colors: true
```

The default value is `false`.

## Logging

Specify the path of the log file `cfy` writes to:

```
logging:
  filename: /some/custom/path/to/a.log
```

The default value is `$TMPDIR/cloudify-$USERNAME/cloudify.log`.

Configure specific python logger levels:

```
logging:
  loggers:
    cloudify.rest_client.http: debug
    some.external.package: debug
```

The default sets `cloudify.cli.main` and `cloudify.rest_client.http` loggers' logging level to `info`.

{{% gsNote title="Note" %}}
The `.cloudify` directory may contain other files and directories that are used internally by `cfy`, those are not addressed in this section.
