The `cfy init` command is used to initialize a working Cloudify directory.

Before you can use `cfy`, you must initialize a working directory for it, in which relevant functional information will be stored.

Running `cfy intall` or `cfy profiles use` initializes an
environment automatically.
{{% /note %}}

#### Usage 
`cfy init [OPTIONS] [BLUEPRINT_PATH]`

Initialize a Cloudify environment.

This is required to perform many actions and should be the first action
performed after installing Cloudify.

Providing a `BLUEPRINT_PATH` also initializes a blueprint to work on.

After initialization, the CLI's configuration can be found under
~/.cloudify/config.yaml. 

#### Optional flags
This command supports the [common CLI flags]({{< relref "cli/_index.md#common-options" >}}).

* `-n, --blueprint-filename TEXT` -  The name of the archive's main blueprint
                                 file. This is only relevant if uploading an
                                 archive.
* `-b, --blueprint-id TEXT` - The unique identifier for the blueprint
* `-r, --reset-config` - 
						Reset the working environment. This allows to reset configuration.
* `-i, --inputs TEXT` - Inputs for the deployment (Can be provided as wildcard
                        based paths (*.yaml, /my_inputs/, etc..) to YAML files,
                        a JSON string or as key1=value1;key2=value2). This
                        argument can be used multiple times.
* `--install-plugins` - Install the necessary plugins for the specified blueprint.
* `--hard` -            Hard reset the configuration, including coloring and
                        loggers.
* `--enable-colors` -   Enable colors in logger. (Use `--hard` when
                                 working with an initialized environment.)
                                 [default: False]
