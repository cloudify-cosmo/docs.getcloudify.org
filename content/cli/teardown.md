The `cfy teardown` command is used to teardown a manager and all its attached resources.

{{% gsNote title="Note" %}}
The teardown process removes the Cloudify Manager VM and any security groups, IP addresses, key pairs that were provisioned during the bootstrap process. Note that, if you used the simple-manager-blueprint to bootstrap Cloudify Manager, no resources are deleted but Cloudify Manager becomes non-functional after the teardown.
