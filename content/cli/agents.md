The `cfy agents` command is used to install Cloudify agents on existing deployments.

After restoring a manager on a new host using a snapshot, this will install new agents on the hosts for the new manager while also leaving the previous agents installed and running.

USE WITH CARE!

This should only be used in very specific cirumstances and should not be used in case:

* The same manager is upgraded using the `cfy upgrade` command.
* To install agents for deployments using an existing manager.
