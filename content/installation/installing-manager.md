A Cloudify Manager is a compute host that runs the Cloudify Management service. For version 4.3 and higher, you can install a single RPM file that installs Cloudify Manager with all of its dependencies. The Cloudify Manager RPM file is self-contained and does not require an internet connection during installation.

 To get started with Cloudify in Amazon AWS or OpenStack, you can also use a [Cloudify Manager image]({{< relref "installation/manager-image.md" >}}).

{{% gsNote title="Prerequisites" %}}

Make sure that your environment meets the [prerequisites]({{< relref "installation/prerequisites.md" >}}) before you install Cloudify Manager.

{{% /gsNote %}}

The installation process installs all of the components that Cloudify depends on. You can run the install command again after the initial installation to reinstall and reconfigure the components. The [configure command]({{< relref "installation/installing-manager.md#changing-the-manager-settings" >}}) lets you reconfigure the components without reinstallation. When you install or configure the Cloudify Manager, you can specify the private IP address, public IP address and administrator password as command options, or specify these and other configuration settings in the [config.yaml file]({{< relref "installation/installing-manager.md#additional-cloudify-manager-settings" >}}).

You can install the [Cloudify CLI]({{< relref "installation/installing-cli.md" >}}) on a separate host to manage your Cloudify Manager remotely.

## Installing Cloudify Manager

_To install Cloudify Manager:_

1. Go to the download page of the [Cloudify website](http://cloudify.co/download/).
1. Copy the link address for the Cloudify Manager rpm file.
1. From the CLI of your target host, run: ```sudo yum install \<rpm file link address>```
   For example: ```sudo yum install http://cloudify-release-eu.s3.amazonaws.com/cloudify/4.3.0/release/cloudify-manager-install-4.3ga.x86_64.rpm```
1. To change the default configuration settings, edit the [config.yaml file]({{< relref "installation/installing-manager.md#additional-cloudify-manager-settings" >}}).
1. To install Cloudify Manager, run: ```cfy_manager install [--private-ip <PRIVATE_IP>] [--public-ip <PUBLIC_IP>] [--admin-password <password>] [-v]```

  * If you specify the private and public IP addresses and the administrator password in the config.yaml file, do not specify them in the command options.
  * If you do not specify an administrator password in the command options or the config.yaml file, the installation process generates a random password and shows it as output when the installation is complete.
  * If you use ```-v``` for the cfy_manager command, you can see additional debugging logs located at: ```/var/log/cloudify/manager/cfy_manager.log```.

{{% gsNote title="Best Practice" %}}

We recommend that you specify an administrator password according to your security policy.

## Other Installation Actions

### Validating the Installation

When the installation process is complete, you can use ```cfy status``` to make sure that all of the Cloudify services are running.
Cloudify Premium customers can access the Cloudify Web Interface at: ```http://<manager_public_address>```

An example output:

$ cfy status

### Configuring the Manager Settings

After you install Cloudify Manager, you can change the settings used by the installation and not reinstall the Cloudify components. The configure command accepts the same CLI settings as the install command, and it reads the config.yaml file for additional settings.

* To change installation settings:
1. To change the configuration settings, edit the [config.yaml file]({{< relref "installation/installing-manager.md#additional-cloudify-manager-settings" >}}).
1. To configure Cloudify Manager, run: ```cfy_manager configure [--private-ip <PRIVATE_IP>] [--public-ip <PUBLIC_IP>] [--admin-password <password>] [-v]```

  * If you specify the private and public IP addresses and the administrator password in the config.yaml file, do not specify them in the command options.
  * If you do not specify an administrator password in the command options or the config.yaml file, the installation process generates a random password and shows it as output when the installation is complete.
  * If you use ```-v``` for the cfy_manager command, you can see additional debugging logs located at: ```/var/log/cloudify/manager/cfy_manager.log```.

### Additional Cloudify Manager Settings

In addition to the command line options, the ```/etc/cloudify/config.yaml``` ([View in GitHub](https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-manager-install)) contains more advanced configuration settings, including:

* Administrator password
* Private and public IP address
* External REST communication over HTTPS
* Local path replacement for remote resources with a URL
* Networks for Cloudify agents
* LDAP connection information
* SSL communication settings

### Emptying the Cloudify Manager Database

{{% gsWarning %}}

Emptying the Cloudify Manager database is irreversible.

{{% /gsWarning %}}

During both installation and configuration of Cloudify Manager, you can use the ```--clean-db``` option to empty all of the data from the Cloudify Manager database.

### Uninstalling Cloudify Manager

* To uninstall the Cloudify Manager, run: ```cfy_manager remove```

* To remove all of the files that the installation process extracted, run: ```yum remove cloudify-manager-install```

## Next Steps

After Cloudify Manager is installed, you can configure your Cloudify Manager for your environment, including:

* [Upload plugins]({{< relref "plugins/using-plugins.md" >}}) to add functionality to Cloudify Manager
* If you intend to use Cloudify to work with LDAP, setup the [LDAP connection]({{< relref "manager_webui/tenant-management-page.md" >}}).
* Build the [secrets store]({{< relref "manager/using-secrets.md" >}}) for your tenants to store data variables that you do not want to expose in plain text in Cloudify, such as login credentials for a platform.
