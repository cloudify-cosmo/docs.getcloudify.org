A Cloudify Manager is a compute host that runs the Cloudify Management service. For version 4.3 and higher, you can install a single RPM file that installs Cloudify Manager with all of its dependencies. The Cloudify Manager RPM file is self-contained and does not require an internet connection during installation.

Make sure that your environment meets the [prerequisites]({{< relref "installation/prerequisites.md" >}}) before you install Cloudify Manager.

{{% /gsNote %}}

When you install Cloudify Manager, you can specify the private IP address, public IP address and administrator password as command parameters. If you use _-v_ for the cfy_manager command, you can see installation logs located at: ```/var/log/cloudify/manager/cfy_manager.log```. You can also specify installation parameters in the [config.yaml file]({{< relref "installation/installing-manager.md#changing-the-manager-parameters" >}}).

{{% gsNote title="Administrator Password" %}}

If you do not specify an administrator password, the installation process generates a random password and shows it as output when the installation is complete. We recommend that you specify an administrator password according to your security policy.

You can install the [Cloudify CLI]({{< relref "installation/installing-cli.md" >}}) on a separate host to manage your Cloudify Manager remotely.

## Other Installation Actions

### Validating the Installation

When the installation process is complete, you can use ```cfy status``` to make sure that all of the Cloudify services are running.
Cloudify Premium customers can access the Cloudify Web Interface at: ```http://<manager_public_address>```

An example output:
{{< gsHighlight  sh >}}
$ cfy status

### Changing the Manager Parameters

Before or after you install Cloudify Manager, you can change the parameters used in the installation. The configure command accepts the same CLI parameters as the install command, and it reads the config.yaml file for additional parameters.

* To change installation parameters, either:
  * Run: ```cfy_manager configure <parameters>```
  * Edit the ```/etc/cloudify/config.yaml``` file and run: ```cfy_manager configure```

The config.yaml ([View in GitHub](https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-manager-install)) contains more advanced configuration parameters, including:

* Administrator password
* Private and public IP address
* External REST communication over HTTPS
* Local path replacement for remote resources with a URL
* Networks for Cloudify agents
* LDAP connection information
* SSL communication settings

### Uninstalling Cloudify Manager

* To uninstall the Cloudify Manager, run: ```cfy_manager remove```

* To remove all of the files that the installation process extracted, run: ```yum remove cloudify-manager-install```

## Next Steps

After Cloudify Manager is installed, you must configure your Cloudify Manager for your environment, including:

* [Upload plugins]({{< relref "plugins/using-plugins.md" >}}) to add functionality to Cloudify Manager
* If you intend to use Cloudify to work with LDAP, setup the [LDAP connection]({{< relref "manager_webui/tenant-management-page.md" >}}).
* Build the [secrets store]({{< relref "manager/using-secrets.md" >}}) for your tenants to store data variables that you do not want to expose in plain text in Cloudify, such as login credentials for a platform.
