 In the event that you need to uninstall Cloudify, use the following procedure.

#### Uninstall Cloudify from Windows

1. Open **Programs** from the **Control Panel**.
2. Select **Cloudify CLI**, then click **Uninstall**.

{{% gsNote title="Uninstalling Python" %}}
Uninstalling the package does not remove Python, pip and Virtualenv, regardless of whether
they were installed during the installation process. You must decide whether to uninstall these components.

To uninstall Python, follow the same uninstall process as described above, selecting **Python** instead of **Cloudify CLI**.
