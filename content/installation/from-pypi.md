Cloudify is also distributed via PyPI. You can install Cloudify from PyPI though we recommend using the script as installing from PyPI does not handle prerequisites and does not provide some other comforts the script is designed to provide.

You must have Python 2.7.x and pip installed and configured on your system.

{{% gsTip title="Using virtualenv" %}}
It's recommended to create a [virtualenv]({{ page.venv_link }}) and install the CLI in it. To do so type the following commands (replace virtual-env-name with the name of your choice, e.g. cloudify:

{{< gsHighlight  bash  >}}
$ virtualenv cloudify
...

$ source cloudify/bin/activate
...

{{< /gsHighlight >}}
