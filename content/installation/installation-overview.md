To run Cloudify, you can either use a [local CLI]({{< relref "cli/overview.md" >}}), or run the [Cloudify Manager installer]({{< relref "manager/bootstrapping.md" >}}).

If you are using the CLI, there are two options for installing Cloudify in your environment, as described below. 

* [Installing Cloudify from an installation package]({{< relref "installation/from-packages.md" >}}).  
  Cloudify packages significantly reduce the initial complexity of the installation process and are the recommended way of installing for new users.
* [Installing Cloudify from a Python or Github source]({{< relref "installation/from-source.md" >}}).  
  If you are an advanced user or developer, you can install Cloudify from Pypi or Github sources.
