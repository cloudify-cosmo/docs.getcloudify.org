A Cloudify Manager is a compute host that runs the Cloudify Management service. For version 4.3 and higher, you can install a single RPM file that installs Cloudify Manager with all of its dependencies. {{/*  This installation also includes plugins and blueprints so you can run a demonstration of the Cloudify features. */}} You can then install the Cloudify CLI on another host to manage your Cloudify Manager remotely.

## Next Steps

After Cloudify Manager is installed, you must configure your Cloudify Manager for your environment, including:

* [Upload plugins]({{< relref "plugins/using-plugins.md" >}}) to add functionality to Cloudify Manager
* If you intend to use Cloudify to work with LDAP, setup the [LDAP connection]({{< relref "manager_webui/tenant-management-page.md" >}}).
* Build the [secrets store]({{< relref "manager/using-secrets.md" >}}) for your tenants.

  The secrets store provides tenant-wide storage for data variables that you might not want to expose in plain text in Cloudify, such as login credentials for a platform. When you use secrets, the plugins that you have uploaded use the secrets to give credential values.
