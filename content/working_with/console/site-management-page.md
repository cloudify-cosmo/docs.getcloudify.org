The default `Site Management` page displays the Sites widget which provides a list of all sites
and enables you to create, update and delete sites.
You can use **Search** input inside Sites widget to filter the sites list.

![Site Management Page]( /images/ui/sitesPage/sites-page.png )


Each site in the list includes the following:

* **Name**
* **Visibility level** - Represented by the icon next to the name. Permitted users (the sites’s creator, sys admins or tenant managers of the current tenant) can set the site’s visibility by clicking on this icon.
* **Location** - The location of the site, represented by latitude and longitude.
* **Creation time**
* **Creator**
* **Tenant** The name of the tenant the site belongs to (if the site is global, it might belong to a tenant different than the current one).
* **Number of deployments assigned to the site**


The right column of the table allows permitted users to edit the site or delete it.
Also, using the “Create” button on the right top corner of the widget, you will be able to create new sites.
