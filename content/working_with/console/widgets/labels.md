Displays the list of labels defined for the deployment which is currently in the context (see [notes]({{< relref "working_with/console/widgets/_index.md" >}}) for more information on resource context).
The table has 3 columns:

- **Key** - label key. All labels starting with `csys-` are reserved for internal usage and should not be used unless there is a need to override the default functionality. The system will prevent overdoing labels that can sacrifice consistency. List of reserved lables: csys-location-lat, csys-env-type, csys-environment, csys-obj-name, csys-location-name, csys-location-long, csys-wrcp-services, csys-obj-parent, csys-wrcp-group-id, csys-obj-type.
- **Value** - label value
- Actions column, containing value edit and label delete action icons, available only to users with `deployment_create` permission
