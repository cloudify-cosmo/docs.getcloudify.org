This section provides a description of all the widgets that are included by default in Cloudify Manager (out-of-the-box). Some of these widgets are presented in the initial page templates, and other can be added from the widgets catalog, accessible when in **Edit Mode**.
If you do not see **Edit Mode** in the dropdown menu, you do not have permissions to edit configuration. 

For information about adding widgets, placing them on a page, and so on, see [Configuring the Cloudify Console Display](({{< relref "working_with/console/configure-display.md" >}})).

**Notes:**<br>

* You might have to configure some of the widgets. In the event that configuration is mandatory, the mandatory requirements are included in the widget descriptions. Many widgets also have non-mandatory configuration that enables you to customize them to your requirements.   

   To open a widget's configuration dialog after you have added it to a page, click the gear icon in the top right of the widget.

* Some widgets are only available for `admin` users. 

The following widgets descriptions are listed in an alphabetical order, as they do in the widgets catalog.
