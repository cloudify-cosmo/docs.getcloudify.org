Buttons which allow running workflows of a specific deployment, updating it or deleting it. The deployment can be selected in one of the following ways: 

* By placing the deployment action buttons in the deployments drill-down page, meaning the deployment has been selected before entering the page, and its id is included in the pageâ€™s context. 
* By adding to the page a widget allowing to select deployments, such as the resources filter or the blueprint deployments
