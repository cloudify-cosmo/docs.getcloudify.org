This section provides a description of all the widgets that are included by default in Cloudify Manager (out-of-the-box). Some of these widgets are presented in the initial page templates, and other can be added from the widgets catalog, accessible when in **Edit Mode**.
If you do not see **Edit Mode** in the dropdown menu, you do not have permissions to edit configuration. 

For information about adding widgets, placing them on a page, and so on, see [Configuring the Cloudify Console Display]({{< relref "working_with/console/configure-display.md" >}}).

**Notes:**<br>

* You might have to configure some of the widgets. In the event that configuration is mandatory, the mandatory requirements are included in the widget descriptions. Many widgets also have non-mandatory configuration that enables you to customize them to your requirements.   

   To open a widget's configuration dialog after you have added it to a page, click the gear icon in the top right of the widget.

* Some widgets are only available for `admin` users. 

The following widgets descriptions are listed in an alphabetical order, as they do in the widgets catalog. 

### Blueprint Sources
Displays all the source files in a blueprint package in tree view, adjacent to the code. When you click an item in the tree, its code is displayed in the code panel. You can also open the file in full mode by clicking on the gray box presenting its name in the top right corner of the widget. 

![blueprint-sources]( /images/ui/widgets/blueprint-sources.png )

#### Widget Settings
* `Content pane initial width in %` - sets the default size of the source part of the window in percent of screen width. Default: 65%. 

### Blueprint action buttons
Buttons that allow performing actions on a selected blueprint - creating a deployment from it, or deleting the blueprint. 
The action buttons need to receive the id of the desired blueprint. This can be accomplished in two ways: 
By placing the buttons in a blueprint’s drill-down page, meaning the blueprint has been selected before entering the page, and its id is included in the page’s context. 
By adding to the page a widget allowing to select blueprints, such as the resources filter or the blueprints list.  

![blueprint-actions]( /images/ui/widgets/blueprint-action-buttons.png )

#### Widget Settings

### Blueprints Catalog

Displays blueprints from a repository under a configurable Github account.
By default, the widget presents the blueprints under cloudify-examples repository, which fit the specific manager’s version. It is configured to read the blueprints URLs from a json file. You can also point the widget to read from a different user account from its settings. The widget includes an upload option for each of the blueprints, which lets you easily upload it to the current tenant on the manager. After uploading a blueprint from the catalog, you will be able to see it under the “local blueprints” widget. 
You can filter the presented blueprints by creating a filter query in the widget’s settings.  
You can and should enter Github credentials for fetching data, as the defaults used by the widgets can reach the restricted query limit of GitHub (~50) . These parameters are pulled from secrets) as the github-username and github-password keys. These parameters are a must if you want to configure the widget to access private repositories.

### Deployment Metric Graph
Displays a chart or charts (up to 5) presenting metric of data collected by using a monitoring plugin in a specific deployment. If when installing Cloudify Manager, influxDB was also installed on the manager, the widgets will read the data from it. Otherwise, an external endpoint for influxDB can be set in the UI’s configurations. You can select the metrics to be displayed in the widget, and define their properties in the widget’s configuration dialog, as long as this data is indeed being collected for the deployments. 
In Cloudify examples, the monitoring is implemented using the Diamond plugin, and the data is being collected to InfluxDB which is installed on the Manager.
You must supply at least one metric or database query in the widget configuration, and choose the specific node instance you want to present the data of. 
You must also provide the Blueprint, Deployment, Node and Node instance IDs, either in the page context or in the widget configuration.

#### Widget Settings
* `Refresh Time Interval` - The time interval in which the widget’s data will be refreshed, in seconds. Default : 5 seconds
* `Node filter` - Use this filter to choose the node instances you want to present the data of. Make sure this are node for which data is indeed collected. You can set Deployment ID and Node instance ID in page context with the[Resource Filter](#resource-filter)
    ![Node filter configuration]( /images/ui/widgets/resource_filter.png)
* `Charts Table` - Table containing definition of up to 5 charts. 
    ![Charts Table configuration]( /images/ui/widgets/deployment-metric-graph-configuration-charts-table.png )
    You can define the following parameters:
    * `Metric` - The specific Diamond metric you want the widget to display. This parameter is mandatory. For more information about these metrics, see the [Diamond documentation](http://diamond.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The available options are dynamically fetched from InfluxDB filtered by `Node filter` parameter.    
    * `Label` - The label to be displayed for the specific chart (the label will be displayed at the bottom of the chart). Parameter is optional. When not specified, then metric name will be taken as chart label.
     
* `Time range and resolution` - Enables you to specify the timeframe of the metrics to be displayed. For details of the configuration see [Time filter widget](#time-filter).
    
* `Custom Influx Query` - By default, the query is based on deployment ID, metric name, time filter and resolution. It is possible to define your own query, which will then be used to fetch data. 
    ![Charts Table configuration]( /images/ui/widgets/deployment-metric-graph-configuration-custom-influx-query.png )
    Query (`select <SELECT column> from <FROM column> where <WHERE column>`) consists of the following parameters:
    * `SELECT` - Defines part of query added just after SELECT keyword. Example: `mean(value)`
    * `FROM` - Defines table from which to fetch data, you can use `${deploymentId}`, `${nodeId}` and `${nodeInstanceId}` tokens to inject dynamic values of appropriate identifiers. Example: `/${deploymentId}..*${nodeInstanceId}.((memory_MemFree))$/`
    * `WHERE` - Defines constraints for the query. You can use `${timeFilter}` token to inject dynamic data/time ranges. Example: `time > now()-1h and time <now() group by time(1m) order asc` or just `${timeFilter}`.
* `Charts Type` - Select one of the following types: line, bar and are chart display.

#### Examples

* multi-metric with line charts

     * by defining custom range
         * using text input - Influx-compatible date/time is allowed. It is possible to define both absolute and relative date/time. For details, see the [Influx documentation - Date time strings](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v0.8/api/query_language/#date-time-strings). Examples: `now() - 15m`  or `2017-09-21 10:10`
         * using calendar picker - You can choose date and time from the calendar/time pickers
     * by choosing predefined range - There are few predefined time ranges available. You can apply them with one click using the buttons on the left side of the filter

* _Time resolution_ - Enables you to group the metrics according to time, to reduce the volume of displayed data. For example, although data might be collected every 10 msecs, you might specify that you only see points on the graph for every minute. Allowed time resolution units: `microseconds`, `milliseconds`, `seconds`, `minutes`, `hours`, `days` and `weeks`. Value ranges from 1 to 1000. 

The filter provides also the following features:

* _Time resolution optimization_ - Automatic time resolution is set when you specify predefined range. It optimizes number of points to fetch from database to maximum 200 per chart. You can also optimize time resolution for custom ranges by clicking `Optimize` button.

### Topology
Displays the topology of a selected blueprint or deployment.
The blueprint or deployment ID must be selected in one of the following ways: 
* By placing the widget in the blueprints/deployments drill-down page, meaning the blueprint/deployment has been selected before entering the page, and its id is included in the page’s context. 
* By adding to the page a widget allowing to select blueprints or deployments, such as the resources filter, the blueprints list or the blueprint deployments.

When executing a `Workflow` for a `Deployment` (e.g. the `install` workflow), the topology nodes show badges that reflect the workflow execution state.<br/>
See more details on executing workflows [here]({{< relref "working_with/manager/execute-workflow.md" >}}).<br/>

#### Badges

* Install state - The workflow execution is in progress for this node
* Done state - The workflow execution was completed successfully for this node
* Alerts state - The workflow execution was partially completed for this node
* Failed state - The workflow execution failed for this node
