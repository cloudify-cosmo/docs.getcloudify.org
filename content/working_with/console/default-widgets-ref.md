This section provides a description of all the widgets that are included by default in Cloudify Manager (out-of-the-box). You can select these widgets from the widgets catalog. 

To view the widgets catalog, from the dropdown menu next to your user name, select **Edit Mode**, then click the **Add Widget** button to display the list of widgets. If you do not see Edit mode in the dropdown menu, you do not have permissions to edit configuration. 


For information about adding widgets, placing them on a page, and so on, see [Configuring the Cloudify Console Display]({{< relref "working_with/console/configure-display.md" >}}).

**Notes:**<br>

* You might have to configure some of the widgets. In the event that configuration is mandatory, the mandatory requirements are included in the widget descriptions. Many widgets also have non-mandatory configuration that enables you to customize them to your requirements.   

   To open a widget's configuration dialog after you have added it to a page, click the gear icon in the top right of the widget.

* Some widgets are only available for `admin` users. 


The widgets are listed according to their category.

## Blueprint Widgets

### Blueprint Sources
Displays all the sources in a blueprint package in tree view, adjacent to the code. When you click an item in the tree, its code is displayed in the code panel.

![blueprint-sources]( /images/ui/widgets/blueprint-sources.png )

### Blueprint deployments
Displays the list of a deployments in the current tenant, according to the logged-in user's permissions. The data can be displayed as a table or list. In the case of a list view, the status of each deployment is also displayed. For information about deployment status, [click here]({{< relref "working_with/console/deployments-page.md" >}})

![blueprint-deployments]( /images/ui/widgets/blueprint-deployments.png )

### Blueprint info
Displays information about a specific blueprint.

#### Configuration
The blueprint ID must be passed to the widget. This can be done either in the page's context, by placing the widget in a blueprint drill-down page, or by specifying the blueprint ID in the widget's configuration.

![blueprint-info]( /images/ui/widgets/blueprint-info.png )

### Blueprints

Displays all the local blueprints on the Cloudify Manager in the context of the current tenant as a table or tile view, according to the logged-in user's permissions. In the catalog view, each blueprint entry includes the icon PNG file with which it was uploaded or the Cloudify default icon if no PNG file was attached.

#### Configuration
In the widget configuration dialog, you can toggle on the **Enable click to drill down** option so that, when the blueprint is clicked, the drill down page is displayed for that blueprint.

![blueprints-list]( /images/ui/widgets/blueprints-list.png )

### Blueprints Catalog

Displays blueprints (as a table or tile view) that exist in a repository under a Github account. 

#### Configuration
You must specify the name of the user account in the widget's settings. The widget includes an `upload` option for each of the blueprints, which lets you easily upload to the manager. 

You can create a filter query in the configuration to specify the blueprints that appear. 

You can also enter a Github credentials to let you fetch data. These parameters are pulled from [secrets]({{< relref "working_with/console/default-widgets-ref.md#secrets-store-management" >}})) as the `github-username` and `github-password` keys. You must enter those secrets to access private repositories.

![deployment-inputs]( /images/ui/widgets/deployment-inputs.png )

### Deployment Outputs

### Deployment Metric Graph
Displays a chart or charts (up to 5) presenting metric data for the current deployment. After you have added the widget to a page, you can select the metrics to be displayed, and define their properties in the widget's configuration dialog. 

#### Configuration

You must supply at least one metric or database query in the widget configuration. You also must enter the Deployment ID and Node instance ID, either in the page context or in the widget configuration. 

The following list provides information regarding parameters that can be specified for this widget. 

* `Refresh Time Interval` - How frequently the data in the widget is refreshed (in secs).
* `Node filter` - Show only data for the specified nodes. Deployment ID and Node Instance ID must be set in the configuration or as part of the page context. You can set Deployment ID and Node instance ID in page context with the [Resource Filter](#resource-filter)
    ![Node filter configuration]( /images/ui/widgets/deployment-metric-graph-configuration-node-filter.png )
* `Charts Table` - Table containing definition of up to 5 charts. 
    ![Charts Table configuration]( /images/ui/widgets/deployment-metric-graph-configuration-charts-table.png )
    You can define the following parameters:  
    * `Metric` - The specific Diamond metric you want the widget to display. This parameter is mandatory. For more information about these metrics, see the [Diamond documentation](http://diamond.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The available options are dynamically fetched from InfluxDB filtered by `Node filter` parameter.    
    * `Label` - The label to be displayed for the specific chart (the label will be displayed at the bottom of the chart). Parameter is optional. When not specified, then metric name will be taken as chart label.
     
* `Time range and resolution` - Enables you to specify the timeframe of the metrics to be displayed. For details of the configuration see [Time filter widget](#time-filter).
    
* `Custom Influx Query` - By default, the query is based on deployment ID, metric name, time filter and resolution. It is possible to define your own query, which will then be used to fetch data. 
    ![Charts Table configuration]( /images/ui/widgets/deployment-metric-graph-configuration-custom-influx-query.png )
    Query (`select <SELECT column> from <FROM column> where <WHERE column>`) consists of the following parameters:
    * `SELECT` - Defines part of query added just after SELECT keyword. Example: `mean(value)`
    * `FROM` - Defines table from which to fetch data, you can use `${deploymentId}`, `${nodeId}` and `${nodeInstanceId}` tokens to inject dynamic values of appropriate identifiers. Example: `/${deploymentId}..*${nodeInstanceId}.((memory_MemFree))$/`
    * `WHERE` - Defines constraints for the query. You can use `${timeFilter}` token to inject dynamic data/time ranges. Example: `time > now()-1h and time <now() group by time(1m) order asc` or just `${timeFilter}`.
* `Charts Type` - Select one of the following types: line, bar and are chart display.


#### Examples

* multi-metric with line charts
![multi-metric example with line charts]( /images/ui/widgets/deployment-metric-graph.png )

* multi-metric with bar charts

![resource-filter-configuration]( /images/ui/ui_resource_filter_configuration.png )

### Event and Logs Filter
See [Event and Logs Filter]({{< relref "working_with/console/default-widgets-ref.md#event-and-logs-filter" >}})

### Time Filter
Displays a time filter for deployment metric graphs. It allows to define:

* _Time range_ - Enables you to choose start (`From`) and end (`To`) dates
     * by defining custom range
         * using text input - Influx-compatible date/time is allowed. It is possible to define both absolute and relative date/time. For details, see the [Influx documentation - Date time strings](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v0.8/api/query_language/#date-time-strings). Examples: `now() - 15m`  or `2017-09-21 10:10`
         * using calendar picker - You can choose date and time from the calendar/time pickers
     * by choosing predefined range - There are few predefined time ranges available. You can apply them with one click using the buttons on the left side of the filter

* _Time resolution_ - Enables you to group the metrics according to time, to reduce the volume of displayed data. For example, although data might be collected every 10 msecs, you might specify that you only see points on the graph for every minute. Allowed time resolution units: `microseconds`, `milliseconds`, `seconds`, `minutes`, `hours`, `days` and `weeks`. Value ranges from 1 to 1000. 

The filter provides also the following features:

* _Time resolution optimization_ - Automatic time resolution is set when you specify predefined range. It optimizes number of points to fetch from database to maximum 200 per chart. You can also optimize time resolution for custom ranges by clicking `Optimize` button. 

* _Time range and resolution reset_ - When you click `Reset` button, both time range and time resolution are reset to default values.

* _Data validation_ - When you click `Apply` button time range is validated. If invalid data is provided, then appropriate input field is marked with red color and time filter window will not be closed.
