{{< param cfy_console_name >}} pages are comprised of widgets. Widgets are dynamic data units that show up to date information. 
You can select which widgets you want to see on each page, and configure the widgets. Default pages provide views of the most commonly required data. You can delete these pages or add your own.

**Edit Mode** enables you to create new dashboard pages, add or remove widgets and manage how widgets are displayed on a page.

If you have a `user` role, your ability to create dashboard pages and manage widgets depends on the configuration permissions that have been set by the administrator.
