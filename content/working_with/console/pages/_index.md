The user interface displays a predefined set of dashboard pages, each of which contains a set of widgets. The widgets are organized on each page to optimize the display of that page's relevant data. The dashboard pages that you see depend on the user role you have.

Admin users can customize each page, including which widgets are shown and their position on the page. More details on how to do that can be found in the [Customization]({{< relref "working_with/console/customization/_index.md" >}}) section. More details about available built-in widgets can be found in the [Widgets]({{< relref "working_with/console/widgets/_index.md" >}}) section.
