The user interface displays a predefined set of dashboard pages, each of which contains a set of widgets. Widgets are organized on a page to optimize the display of relevant data. The dashboard pages that you see depend on whether you have an `admin` or `user` role.

Admin users can customize each page, including which widgets are shown and their position on the page. More details how to do that can be found in [Customization]({{< relref "working_with/console/customization/_index.md" >}}) section.
