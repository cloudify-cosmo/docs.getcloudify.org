The default Executions page displays the number of currently running executions as well as bar graph showing number of executions in different states. 
In addition to that there is the [Executions widget]({{< relref "working_with/console/widgets/executions.md" >}}) which provides a list of all the executions.
The list can be filtered using the [Resource filter widget]({{< relref "working_with/console/widgets/filter.md" >}}).
