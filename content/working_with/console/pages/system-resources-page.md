## Plugins

[Plugins widget]({{< relref "working_with/console/widgets/plugins.md" >}}) lists the plugins available to the current tenant.
 
By default, [plugins]({{< relref "working_with/official_plugins/_index.md" >}}) are tenant-specific, meaning that a blueprint on one tenant cannot access a plugin on a different tenant. You can also set a plugin as global or private when you upload it to the manager.


## Secrets

Secret storage provides a tenant-wide variable store for data that you do not want to expose in plain text in Cloudify blueprints, such as login credentials for a platform. 

See [Secrets widget]({{< relref "working_with/console/widgets/secrets.md" >}}) page for details.


## Agents

Agents are components installed on hosts that are part of your blueprint. The Agent executes orchestration operations locally, collects metrics and report them to the Cloudify Manager. 

You can find more information on [Agents widget]({{< relref "working_with/console/widgets/agents.md" >}}) page.
