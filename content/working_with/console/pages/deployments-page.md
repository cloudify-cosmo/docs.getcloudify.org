The default Deployments page displays the [Deployments widget]({{< relref "working_with/console/widgets/deployments.md" >}}) which provides a list of all deployments 
and enables you to create, update and delete deployments and execute workflows.
You can list only deployments created basing on specific blueprint by selecting 
the blueprint from [Resource Filter widget]({{< relref "working_with/console/widgets/filter.md" >}}) below [Create Deployment button]({{< relref "working_with/console/widgets/deploymentButton.md" >}}). 
In the same way, you can list only deployments assigned to the same site.
