Plugins page lists the plugins available to the current tenant.

![Plugins Page]( /images/ui/pages/plugins-page.png )

By default, [plugins]({{< relref "working_with/official_plugins/_index.md" >}}) are tenant-specific, meaning that a blueprint on one tenant cannot access a plugin on a different tenant. You can also set a plugin as global or private when you upload it to the manager.

See [Plugins widget]({{< relref "working_with/console/widgets/plugins.md" >}}) page for details.
