![Dashboard page]( /images/ui/ui-dashboard-page.png )

By default, the page displays the most commonly used widgets, including the number of blueprints, deployments, plugins, node instances and running executions on this Cloudify Manager. You can also go to Getting Started Walkthrough tour.  

An overview of the current and recent processes on the Cloudify Manager is provided by list of all the executions on the Cloudify manager. You can configure it to show executions for a specific blueprint or deployment.
