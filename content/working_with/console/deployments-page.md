The default `Deployments` page displays the Deployments widget which provides a list of all deployments 
and enables you to create, update and delete deployments and execute workflows.

You can list only deployments created basing on specific blueprint by selecting 
the blueprint from Resource Filter widget below Create Deployment button. 

You can also use **Search** input inside Deployments widget to filter deployments list.

Each deployment in the list includes details about the attached blueprint, 
when the deployment was created and updated and the nodes on which it is deployed. 

In addition, the status of the deployments on the nodes is indicated as follows:
