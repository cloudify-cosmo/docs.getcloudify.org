The secrets store provides a variable storage (key-value pairs) for data that you do not want to expose in plain text in Cloudify blueprints, such as login credentials for a platform.
When you create a secret, the key value can be a text string or it can be a file that contains the key value. With the secrets store, you can  make sure all secrets (for example credentials to IaaS environments) are stored separately from blueprints, and adhere to isolation requirements between different tenants. You can include the secret's key in your blueprints and not include the actual values in the blueprints.
For more information, see the [get_secret]({{< relref "developer/blueprints/spec-intrinsic-functions.md#get-secret" >}}) intrinsic function.

### Creating a secret via the CLI

The `cfy secrets` command is used to manage Cloudify secrets (key-value pairs).

{{< highlight  bash  >}}
$ cfy secrets create test -s test_value
...

Secret `test` created

...
{{< /highlight >}}

For more commands, see [secrets command line]({{< relref "cli/secrets.md" >}}).
