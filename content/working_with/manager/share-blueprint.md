# About
For enabling a fully shareable blueprint or a resource this two abilities were added : [importing a catalog
blueprint](https://docs.cloudify.co/latest/developer/blueprints/spec-imports/#importing-catalog-blueprints) and adding a [namespace](https://docs.cloudify.co/4.5.0/developer/blueprints/spec-imports/#namespace) context to any import available resource. With those two it is possible to share any common blueprint
definitions, from a simple data types definitions through an architecture common pattern (like creating an openstack VM with
all of its requirements) and up to entire micro-services that are found across in several services.   

# Namespace
The namespace context is added to all the DSL elements that may be referenced, allowing the blueprint to safely be
imported and used in other blueprints, without fear of name collisions.
This contributes a great deal for common blueprint patterns that now can be imported several times under different
namespaces and be used with no unwanted duplications across deployments. ** Notice: ** Cloudify basic types definition can not receive namespace.

# Catalog Blueprint   
With the ability to import a catalog blueprint, blueprints are now truly shareable building blocks that can be used across
deployments ranging from sharing a basic definition blueprint to sharing DBs, Message brokers blueprints building block and
even sharing entire micro-services blueprints as integral pieces. Which will reduce blueprint duplication across deployments
and will allow for a better way of consuming shareable building blocks.      

# Example

In an Openstack cloud environment, a very basic building block could be a blueprint which creates a VM on open stack.

Basic Openstack VM blueprint with a single port opened:

An application deployed on Openstack using the openstack VM blueprint:

{{< highlight  yaml >}}

tosca_definitions_version: cloudify_dsl_1_3

imports:
  - openstack_infra--blueprint:openstack_vm

node_templates:
  http_web_server:
    type: openstack_infra--cloudify.nodes.WebServer
    properties:
      port: { get_input: openstack_infra--port }
    relationships:
      - type: openstack_infra--cloudify.relationships.contained_in
        target: openstack_infra--vm
    interfaces:
      cloudify.interfaces.lifecycle:
        configure: scripts/configure.sh
        start: scripts/start.sh
        stop: scripts/stop.sh

outputs:
  http_endpoint:
    description: Web server external endpoint
    value: { concat: ['http://', { get_attribute: [openstack_infra--virtual_ip, floating_ip_address] },
                      ':', { get_property: [http_web_server, openstack_infra--port] }] }
{{< /highlight >}}

And if "hello world" is useful micro service in another service, which need an "hello-world" service in port 8080 and
one in port 9090. That blueprint will look like this: 

{{< highlight  yaml >}}

tosca_definitions_version: cloudify_dsl_1_3

imports:
  - port_8080--hello.yaml
  - port_9090--hello.yaml

{{< /highlight >}}

Thanks to those two abilities it's very easy to use shareable building block and distribute them across deployments and
across projects.
