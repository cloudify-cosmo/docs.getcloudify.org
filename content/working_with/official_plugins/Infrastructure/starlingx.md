The StarlingX plugin enables you to discover StarlingX systems and manage resources on StarlingX systems.

Start out by providing the credentials for an existing StarlingX system. The install workflow will gather information from the system, for example type and location.

To discover subclouds, execute the `discover_and_deploy` workflow over a Controller deployment. This workflow performs the following tasks:

  - Discover all subclouds that are managed by the system controller (parent).
  - Create a deployment group.
  - Create a deployment for each discovered subcloud. Add the subcloud deployment to the deployment group.
  - Execute batch install on the deployment group.


__NOTE: The StarlingX Plugin is designed to work with the StarlingX blueprint, which is located in the examples directory of the plugin repository.__


# Requirements

* Python versions:
  * 3.6.x

# Labels

The following are possible for a StarlingX system deployment:

  - `csys-obj-type`
  - `csys-env-type`
  - `csys-obj-parent`
  - `csys-location-name`
  - `csys-location-lat`
  - `csys-location-long`
  - `csys-wrcp-services`

# Sites

During installation the plugin requests a system's location (latitude and longitude) from the StarlingX API, and creates a [Site]({{< relref "working_with/console/widgets/sites.md" >}}) in Cloudify. You can see sites' location on the map on the Dashboard screen.

# Node Types

## **cloudify.nodes.starlingx.WRCP**

This node represents a StarlingX System. A system can be a System Controller, Standalone system, or a Subcloud.

**Properties**

  * `use_external_resource`: Always true. This parameters indicates that the resource already exists.

  * `client_config`: A dictionary containing the following keys:
    * `auth_url`: The StarlingX system endpoint, including the protocol, IP, port, and path, e.g. `https://172.20.0.1:5000/v3`. IPv6 systems' auth urls, should be provided with the IP surrounded by square brackets, e.g. `https://[2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334]:5000/v3`.
    * `username`: The StarlingX username.
    * `api_key`: The StarlingX password.
    * `project_name`: The client project name, default: `admin`.
    * `user_domain_name`: The client user domain name, default: `Default`.
    * `project_domain_name`: The client project domain name, default: `Default`.
    * `region_name`: The region name, either `RegionOne` for a system controller, or the subcloud name in the case that the system is a subcloud.
    * `insecure`: Whether to ignore certification validation when using `https` as the protocol..
    * `cacert`: The content of a Certificate Authority when using `https` as the protocol.

  * `resource_config`: Parameters that describe the system in the StarlingX API. Currently, there is no need to provide these parameters.

**Runtime Properties**:

  * `subclouds`: A dictionary of subclouds if the node is a system controller that has subclouds.
    * A key containing a number representing the subcloud number:
      * `external_id`: The number representing the subcloud number.
      * `name`: The subcloud name.
      * `description`: The subcloud descriptions.
      * `location`: The subcloud location, for example an address.
      * `group_id`: The subcloud's group ID.
      * `group_name`: The subcloud's group name.
      * `oam_floating_ip`: The IP of the subcloud.
      * `management_state`: The subcloud's management state.

  * `resource_config`:
    * `external_id`: The system's ID.
    * `name`: The system's name.
    * `description`: The system's description.
    * `location`: The system's location, for example an address.
    * `system_type`: The system type, for example, "all-in-one".
    * `system_mode`: The system mode, for example, "simplex".
    * `region_name`: The region name, for example "RegionOne", or if a subcloud, the subcloud name.
    * `latitude`: The latitude of the system.
    * `longitude`: The longitude of the system.
    * `distributed_cloud_role`: The distributed_cloud_role, for example "subcloud".

  * `hosts`:
    * A key containing an UUID representing the host ID.
      * `hostname`: The host's hostname.
      * `personality`: The host's personality, for example "controller".
      * `capabilities`: The host's capabilities.
      * `subfunctions`: The host's subfunctions.

  * `kube_clusters`: The API response for the system's kube_cluster object.

  * `k8s_cluster_name`: If the system has a Kubernetes cluster, the kube cluster's name.

  * `k8s_ip`: The IP of the Kubernetes cluster, if the system has one.

  * `k8s_service_account_token`: The service account token, if the system has a Kubernetes Cluster.

  * `k8s_cacert`: The Kubernetes Cluster certificate authority if the system has a Kubernetes Cluster.

  * `k8s_admin_client_cert`: The Kubernetes Cluster client certificate if the system has a Kubernetes Cluster.

  * `k8s_admin_client_key`: The Kubernetes Cluster client key if the system has a Kubernetes Cluster.

  * `openstack_ip`: The system's Openstack IP if it hosts an Openstack system.

  * `openstack_key`:  The system's Openstack key if it hosts an Openstack system.


**Workflows**

  * `discover_and_deploy`: The workflow will create a deployment group. It will then create deployments for all of the subclouds that are discovered. It will put all of the those subclouds in the group. It will then execute batch install on all of the subcloud deployments.

**Stories**

The StarlingX plugin supports the following stories:

   * Enrolling a StarlingX System Controller.
   * Enrolling an All-in-one StarlingX System.
   * Discovering the subclouds of a StarlingX System Controller, and automatically deploying them.
   * Manually enrolling a subcloud of a StarlingX System Controller.


_NOTE: Manual enrollment requires you to assign the `csys-obj-parent` label._


___Prerequisites___

All stories require that you provide a secrets for the following values:

  - `username`: The default secret name is `starlingx_username`. This is the username of the StarlingX system.
  - `api_key`: The default secret name is `starlingx_api_key`. The is the password to your StarlingX system.
  - `cacert`: The default secret name is `starlingx_cacert`. This is the content of the certificate authority file. 

You are free to change the names of the secrets, however, you must provide the secret names in the deployment inputs when enrolling a new system.

  * `Enroll StarlingX System Controller`: You will need the `auth_url` of the controller, for example, `https://123.123.123.123:5000/v3`.
  * `Enroll StarlingX Subcloud`: You will need the `auth_url` of the controller, for example, `https://123.123.123.123:5000/v3`. You will also need the subcloud name, and provide it as the `region_name` input.
  * Discover Subclouds - execute the `discover_and_deploy` workflow. Provide no parameters.
