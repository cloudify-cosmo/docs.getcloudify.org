# Overview

Cloudify Plugins are Python packages that do the work of communicating with external systems. Primarily:

  </div>
</p>

For example:

  * If you want to create a VM in Azure, you will need the [Azure plugin]({{< relref "working_with/official_plugins/Infrastructure/azure.md" >}}).
  * If you want to configure a server with an Ansible playbook, you will use the [Ansible plugin]({{< relref "working_with/official_plugins/Configuration/ansible.md" >}}).
  * If you have existing scripts, you may simply use the built-in [Script plugin]({{< relref "working_with/official_plugins/Configuration/script.md" >}}).

# Background

[Blueprints]({{< relref "developer/blueprints" >}}) use the Cloudify DSL to model an application. The model, or node_templates section, describes a topology which includes:
  * [Node Templates]({{< relref "developer/blueprints/spec-node-templates" >}})
  * [Relationships]({{< relref "developer/blueprints/spec-relationships" >}}) between node templates.

[Workflows]({{< relref "developer/blueprints/spec-workflows" >}}) actualize the topology by defining the order of operations that will be performed. For example, the built-in [Install Workflow]({{< relref "working_with/workflows/built-in-workflows.md#the-install-workflow" >}}) calls, among other things, the `create`, `configure`, and `start` operations defined for a particular [node type]({{< relref "developer/blueprints/spec-node-types" >}}).

Plugins contain the Python code that each workflow operation calls.

# Usage

In your blueprint, use the [Import]({{< relref "developer/blueprints/spec-imports" >}}) statement to import plugins, for example:

```yaml
imports:
  - plugin: cloudify-azure-plugin
```

You can then map node template and relationship operations to plugin code, or if your plugin's `plugin.yaml` has custom node types, these operations may already be mapped for you.

## Example Blueprint with REST Call

The following example illustrates configuration step. In it, we create a user via some REST API.

In the blueprint, we define the lifecycle steps, along with the inputs for the plugin operation:

  * endpoint information
  * reference to a template file containing the REST request itself.
  * parameters

```yaml
tosca_definitions_version: cloudify_dsl_1_3
imports:
  - http://cloudify.co/spec/cloudify/5.0.0/types.yaml
  - plugin:cloudify-utilities-plugin
inputs:
  rest_endpoint:
    description: >
      REST API endpoint of the pfSense instance
node_templates:
  user-post:
    type: cloudify.rest.Requests
    properties:
      hosts: [{ get_input: rest_endpoint }]
      port: 443
      ssl: true
      verify: false
    interfaces:
      cloudify.interfaces.lifecycle:
        start:
          inputs:
            template_file: templates/create-user-post-template.yaml
            params:
              USER_ID: {get_attribute: [user-details, user, id]}
              USERNAME: { get_attribute: [user-details, user, username] }
              WEBSITE: { get_attribute: [user-details, user, website] }
              POST_ID: "1"
```

Let's break down each section:

  * `tosca_definitions_version`: This is the version of Cloudify's DSL. You should not need to change this value.
  * `imports`: This is a list of URLs or paths to more Cloudify DSL files. These define `node_types` and `relationships`, among other things, that will be used in your blueprint.
  * `inputs`: These are parameters that you should know before running your blueprint, such as API endpoints.
  * `node_templates`: These are the nodes that you will handle throughout your deployment, such as VMs, applications, or network components.

Now, let's talk about our `node_template`:

  * The name of our node template is `user-post`, and it is of node type `cloudify.rest.Requests`, which is defined in the `plugin:cloudify-utilities-plugin` import.
  * The node type `cloudify.rest.Requests` defines endpoint information in the `properties` section.
  * The `interfaces` section defines how we map our operation. The install workflow calls a `start` operation. So that is the only operation that will be executed in this blueprint.
  * We provide `inputs` to the operation which are basically Python function parameters.
    * `template_file`: This is a Jinja2 template file, which contains a list of REST requests (see below).
    * `params`: These are params to the Jinja2 template, which define the user we will create.

**create-user-post-template.yaml**

This is the template file, which contains a list of requests. We define the `path`, the `payload`, and define the expected responses.

```yaml
rest_calls:
 # create user post
  - path: /posts/{{POST_ID}}
    method: PUT
    headers:
      Content-type: application/json
    payload:
      title: '{{ USERNAME }}'
      body: '{{ WEBSITE }}'
      userId: '{{ USER_ID }}'
    response_format: json
    recoverable_codes: [400]
    response_expectation:
      - ['id', '{{POST_ID}}']
```

Only one request is defined here, but you can define bunch requests as well as successful and failure responses.

For more information on modeling REST request sequences, see the [REST Plugin]({{< relref "working_with/official_plugins/Configuration/utilities/rest" >}}).


## Example Blueprint with Example Script

A another way to understand using Cloudify plugins is to use Cloudify with existing scripts.

For example, let's say that you have a BASH script like this:

**scripts/hello.sh**

```shell
#!/bin/bash
# myblueprint/scripts/hello.sh
ctx logger info "Hello World"
```

All this script does right now is log a "Hello World" message message to Cloudify. However, you can put just about any valid BASH script here.

To run the following, you will need the following for a real VM:

  * `ip`: A routeable IP to the VM with a responsive SSH server.
  * `username`: The SSH user for that VM.
  * `private_key`: The content of the private key for that SSH user.

```yaml
tosca_definitions_version: cloudify_dsl_1_3
imports:
  - http://cloudify.co/spec/cloudify/5.0.0/types.yaml
inputs:
  username:
    type: string
  private_key:
    type: string
  ip_address:
    type: string
node_templates:
  node:
    type: cloudify.nodes.Compute
    properties:
      ip: { get_input: ip_address }
      agent_config:
        install_method: remote
        user: { get_input: username }
        key: { get_input: private_key }
    interfaces:
      cloudify.lifecycle.interface:
        start:
          implementation: scripts/hello.sh
```

Let's review:
  * In the `properties`, we define the method for installing and configuring a Cloudify Agent on the VM. We provide the IP and authentication information.
  * We define the `start` operation as the execution of our `hello.sh` script from above.

For more information, see the [Script Plugin]({{< relref "working_with/official_plugins/Configuration/script" >}}).


## Example Blueprint with Blueprint Mapped Operations

The following example describes configuring one or more hosts with Ansible.

Just like last example, you will need the following for a real VM:

  * `ip`: A routeable IP to the VM with a responsive SSH server.
  * `username`: The SSH user for that VM.
  * `private_key`: The content of the private key for that SSH user.

```yaml
tosca_definitions_version: cloudify_dsl_1_3
imports:
  - http://cloudify.co/spec/cloudify/5.0.0/types.yaml
  - plugin:cloudify-ansible-plugin
inputs:
  ip:
    type: string
  username:
    type: string
  private_key:
    type: string
node_templates:
  kubespray:
    type: cloudify.nodes.Root
    interfaces:
      cloudify.interfaces.lifecycle:
        configure:
          implementation: ansible.cloudify_ansible.tasks.run
          inputs:
            playbook_path: myplaybook.yml
            sources:
              webservers:
                hosts:
                  web:
                    ansible_host: { get_input: ip }
                    ansible_user: { get_input: username }
                    ansible_ssh_private_key_file: { get_input: private_key }
                    ansible_become: True
                    ansible_ssh_common_args: -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no
```

In this blueprint, we don't define any properties. Instead, we map everything as an operation.

  * `ansible.cloudify_ansible.tasks.run` is a task defined in the Ansible Plugin. All it does is run the `ansible-playbook` command against the provided playbook and inventory.
  * `playbook_path`: this parameter is the path to the Playbook YAML file. (This parameter was previously called `site_yaml_path`.)
  * `sources`: this parameter is an Ansible Inventory structure in YAML format.

For more information, see the [Ansible Plugin]({{< relref "working_with/official_plugins/Configuration/ansible" >}}).


## Example Blueprint with Custom Node Types

The following example describes the creation of a connected AWS EC2 Internet Gateway and VPC. The `cloudify-aws-plugin`'s `plugin.yaml` already defines the node types `cloudify.nodes.aws.ec2.InternetGateway` and `cloudify.nodes.aws.ec2.Vpc`, and maps their lifecycle operations to plugin tasks.

You will need the following [secrets]({{< relref "developer/blueprints/spec-secretstore" >}}):
  * `aws_access_key_id`: The AWS Access Key.
  * `aws_secret_access_key`: The AWS Secret Key.

You will also need to provide the following inputs:
  * `region_name`: The AWS region name.

```yaml
tosca_definitions_version: cloudify_dsl_1_3
imports:
  - http://cloudify.co/spec/cloudify/5.0.0/types.yaml
  - plugin:cloudify-aws-plugin
inputs:
  region_name:
    type: string
dsl_definitions:
  _: &client_config
    aws_access_key_id: { get_secret: aws_access_key_id }
    aws_secret_access_key: { get_secret: aws_secret_access_key }
    region_name: { get_input: region_name }
node_templates:
  internet_gateway:
    type: cloudify.nodes.aws.ec2.InternetGateway
    properties:
      client_config: *client_config
    relationships:
    - type: cloudify.relationships.connected_to
      target: vpc
  vpc:
    type: cloudify.nodes.aws.ec2.Vpc
    properties:
      resource_config:
        CidrBlock: { get_input: vpc_cidr }
      client_config: *client_config
```

Let's review:

We have the following nodes:
  * `internet_gateway`: This is an internet gateway. We use a `cloudify.relationships.connected_to` relationship to define dependency on `vpc`.
  * `vpc`: This is a VPC.

Properties:
  * We provide to both resources their configuration in the `resource_config` property.
  * Authentication is defined in the `client_config` property.
