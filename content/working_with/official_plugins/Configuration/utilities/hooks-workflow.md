# Cloudify Utilities: hooks-workflow

This plugin enables to run a workflow as an actionable event(The example demonstrates run an uninstall workflow when  install workflow failed).

Firstly, in order to hook an event, Add event handler to `/opt/mgmtworker/config/hooks.conf`(An example event provided on the example section).

Supported parameters(inputs):

  * `inputs`: passed from cloudify hooks (or first param hooks).
  * `logger_file`: duplicate logger output to separate file.
  * `client_config`: custom credentials for manager, by default is not required for use.
  * `filter_by`: key-value list, where:
    * `path`: path to field for validate,
    * `values`: list of possible values
  * `workflow_for_run`: name workflow to run on deployment.
  * `workflow_params`: additional parameter for workflow.

Deployment properties combined for `filter_by`:

 * `deployment_inputs`: deployment inputs.
 * `deployment_outputs`: deployment outputs.
 * `deployment_capabilities`: deployment capabilities.

Additionally inputs for filter:

 * `execution_parameters`: parameters originaly received for execution.
 * `is_system_workflow`: type workflow, e.g.: True/False.
 * `blueprint_id`: blueprint id.
 * `tenant_name`: tenant name.
 * `rest_token`: rest token.
 * `workflow_id`: workflow id, e.g.: `install`
 * `arguments`: resulted arguments.
 * `timestamp`: current time stamp.
 * `deployment_id`: deployment id.
 * `message_type`: type of hooks message.
 * `execution_id`: execution id.
 * `event_type`: hooks type, e.g.: `workflow_failed`.


`workflow_params`(in the actionable event inputs) can be:

 * `parameters`: Parameters for the workflow execution.
 * `allow_custom_parameters`: Determines whether to allow parameters which
  weren't defined in the workflow parameters schema in the blueprint.
 * `force`: Determines whether to force the execution of the workflow in a
  case where there's an already running execution for this deployment.
 * `dry_run`: If set to true, no actual actions will be performed. This is
  a dry run of the execution
 * `queue`: If set, blocked executions will be queued and automatically run
  when possible
 * `schedule`: A string representing the date and time this workflow should
  be executed at. If not passed this workflow will be executed immediately.

## example:

 * Add event handler to `/opt/mgmtworker/config/hooks.conf`

[See the documentation for more information](https://docs.cloudify.co/5.0.5/working_with/manager/actionable-events/).
```yaml
hooks:
- event_type: workflow_failed
  implementation: cloudify-utilities-plugin.cloudify_hooks_workflow.tasks.run_workflow
  inputs:
    logger_file: /tmp/workflow_failed.log
    workflow_for_run: uninstall
    workflow_params: {}
    filter_by:
    - path: ["workflow_id"]
      values: ["install"]
    - path: ["deployment_capabilities", "autouninstall", "value"]
      values: [true, "yes"]

```

 * Clone [cloudify_hooks_workflow](https://github.com/cloudify-community/blueprint-examples/tree/master/utilities-examples/cloudify_hooks_workflow) folder from Blueprint examples repo.

 * check that all deployments with `autouninstall` prefix uninstalled.
```shell
# will be uninstalled after install
cfy install check-failure.yaml -b check1
# will save alive as deployments is not failed
cfy install check-failure.yaml -b check2 -i raise_failure_first=ignore_action
# will be stay failed
cfy install check-failure.yaml -b check3 -i autouninstall=no
```
