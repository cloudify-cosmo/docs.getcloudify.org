# Cloudify Utilities: Files Plugin

The files utility allows you to package a file with a blueprint and move it onto a managed Cloudify Compute node.

# Node types:
    
## cloudify.nodes.File
**Derived From:** [cloudify.nodes.Root]({{< relref "developer/blueprints/built-in-types.md" >}})

This is node type that describes the file to transfer.


**Properties:**


  * `resource_config` - a dictionary that represent the file resource.
    
    *type:* cloudify.datatypes.File
    
    *required: true* 
    
Fields(from plugin.yaml):

```yaml
  cloudify.datatypes.File:
    properties:
      resource_path:
        type: string
        description: >
          The path relative to the blueprint where the file is stored.
          Currently this must be packaged in the blueprint. An external URI is
          not valid.
        required: true
      file_path:

**Add a repo file to a VM:**

```yaml
  docker_yum_repo:
    type: cloudify.nodes.File
    properties:

        resource_path: resources/docker.repo
        file_path: /etc/yum.repos.d/docker.repo
        owner: root:root
        mode: 644
```
