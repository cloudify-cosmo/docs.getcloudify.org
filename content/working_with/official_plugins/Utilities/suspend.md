  that has such operation. For backward compatibility also run deprecated.
  `cloudify.interfaces.lifecycle.resume`.

### Notes:

Abbreviations:

* `N/A` - Not supported by plugin.
* `Y` - Supported by plugin.
* `Y (Bypassed)` - Can be bypassed by separate API or property.
* `Y (By VM)` - Created automatically by run action on connected VM.
* `Y (By Compare)` - Code show difference between states without reconfigure object.
* `N (No API)` - Unsupported by infrastructure API.

All workflows have support for:

* `include_instances` parameter for specifying list of instances id's that operations will take place on them.
* `skip_actions` node property check for disabling specific actions on the node.

Backup types:

* `Snapshot` has such meaning - some objects that directly connected to parent object
   (like: VM/Compute/Volume) and what saved is difference between states of object.
* `Backup` has such meaning - some objects contain a full copy of the original object and can
   be used after removing the original object.

For partial backup can be used `include_instances` for limit list of instances or
split installation to several deployments and run on deployments one by one.

OpenStack:

* Plugin will remove all binded snapshot before delete volume automatically.
* Volume backups, VM backups, VM snapshots are removed only for delete backup
   workflow, in other cases user should remove images manually.
* Plugins 2.7.+ and 3.0.+ can have different functionality coverage.

VSphere:

* Plugin will remove all binded snapshot before delete vm.
* User should remove snapshots before attach/detach devices from/to vm.

LibVirt:

* Plugin will remove all binded snapshot before delete vm.
* Plugin create xml backups in current directory by default.

## Backup/Shapshot workflows:

We provide for use 3 workflows: create/restore/remove_backup.

### Backup

The `Backup` workflow has the following parameters:

* `snapshot_name`: Backup name/tag. By default will be used "backup-<timestamp>"
* `snapshot_incremental`: Create incremental snapshots or full backup. By default
    created snapshots.
* `snapshot_type`: The backup type, like 'daily' or 'weekly'. By default: irregular
* `snapshot_rotation`: How many backups to keep around. By default: 1

The meaning of each param depends on plugin implementation and can have a different sense
for each plugin.

For example, openstack use parameters in such way:

* `Snapshot name`: Used as suffix for created `objects`. As object can be different
   things like images, volume snapshots, or backups. The name of a resulted object is
   something like ```<object type>-<original object id>-<backup name>```. We need that
   because the result of VM snapshot, VM backup, and Volume backup
   is an image, hence we need some information in the name to understand the id of the parent object
   for backup.
* `Snapshot_incremental`: plugin use to separate type of resulted objects.
   If `Snapshot_incremental=True` - code will try to create snapshot of object,
   for different plugins it can be contain different information. In case Openstack it
   will be Image with full copy of VM or subobject contained in volume that can be
   exported as image.
   If `Snapshot_incremental=False` - code will try to create copy of VM as image or
   copy of Volume as image.
* `snapshot_rotation`: used only with VM snapshot as rotation field in metadata.
* `snapshot_type`: used with VM snapshots as part of image metadata and as
   description in snapshot metadata.

OpenStack plugin does not make any decisions based on `snapshot_type` / `snapshot_rotation`
values and is passing these values without any changes. The plugin is not
responsible for removing all old backups or snapshots by rotation field.

### Restore

The `Restore` workflow has the following parameters:

* `snapshot_name`: Backup name/tag. By default will be used "backup-<timestamp>"
* `snapshot_incremental`: Restore from incremental snapshots or full backup.
   By default restored from snapshots.

Both parameters have the same meaning as in backup workflow.

For openstack:

* VM's: Code search images with same name as we used for create backup/snapshot
   image and rebuild VM with use such name as base.
* Volumes: if the customer has tried to restore from a snapshot - we show a warning and
   ignore the action. In case the customer has used backup - we ask OpenStack to
   restore the volume from backup. Such logic is a limitation of OpenStack, hence we can
   only restore volumes from backups for now.

### Remove backup

The `Remove backup` workflow has the following parameters:

* `snapshot_name`: Backup name/tag. By default will be used "backup-<timestamp>"
* `snapshot_incremental`: Delete incremental snapshots or full backup.
    By default removed snapshots.

Both parameters have the same meaning as in backup workflow.

For OpenStack:

* VM's - search image created by backup workflow and delete if found such.
* Volume - search image created as backup for volume or remove snapshot with
  such name in volume.

### Internal implementation/logic in utilities plugin.

In backup/restore workflow:

* call action `cloudify.interfaces.freeze.fs_prepare` for all non compute nodes.
   This action is supposed to stop service before run real backup.
* call action `cloudify.interfaces.freeze.fs_prepare` for compute nodes.
   This action is supposed for run sync/freeze fs before run real backup.
* call action `cloudify.interfaces.snapshot.create` for all nodes in deployment.
   This action is supposed for low level create backup of volume or vm in
   infrastructure. if user implemented callback for action - can be used
   for made backup of service db.
* call action `cloudify.interfaces.freeze.fs_finalize` for compute nodes.
   This action is supposed for run unfreeze fs before run real backup.
* call action `cloudify.interfaces.freeze.fs_finalize` for all non compute nodes.
   This action supposed for start all serviced stopped at the start of workflow.

Plugin needs to run `fs_prepere` for `restore` workflow - because plugin needs
to have consistent state before run any `restore`/`apply` backups - so if
service has some suspend before backup we need to stop candidate for restore
before any real action.

All actions receive all params as we have as inputs for workflow without any changes.
So user defined actions can make some decisions based on such params.

In `remove backup workflow` plugin calls remove backup action on all instances in
deployment without any additional `actions` for freeze or stop services.
So remove backup is safe action without functionality degradation of deployment.

# Usage example:


`1`. Upload the [blueprint](https://github.com/cloudify-community/blueprint-examples/blob/master/utilities-examples/cloudify_suspend/example.yaml) :

`cfy blueprints upload example.yaml `

`2`. Create deployment: 

`cfy deployments create -b cloudify-suspend`

`3`. Call 'suspend' workflow:

Suspend:

```shell
$ cfy execution start suspend -d cloudify-suspend 
Executing workflow `suspend` on deployment `cloudify-suspend` [timeout=900 seconds]
