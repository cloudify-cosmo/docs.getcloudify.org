# vSphere Plugin Configuration
The vSphere plugin requires credentials and endpoint setup information in order to authenticate and interact with vSphere.

## Accessing Secrets

 It is recommended that you store your credentials as [secrets]({{< relref "working_with/manager/using-secrets.md" >}}). You can do this using the [CLI]({{< relref "cli/secrets.md" >}}).
 Secrets can then be accessed inside your blueprints, as follows:

 {{< highlight  yaml  >}}
 external_network:
    type: cloudify.vsphere.nodes.Network
    properties:

      connection_config:  
        username: { get_secret: vsphere_username }
        password: { get_secret: vcenter_password }
        host: { get_secret: vcenter_hostname_or_ip }
        datacenter_name: { get_secret: datacenter_name }            
 {{< /highlight >}}   

## Providing Credentials as Environment Variables that are not Stored as Secrets
If you do not use secret storage, you must provide the following credentials as environment variables:

{{< highlight  yaml  >}}
       connection_config:  
        username: { vsphere_username }
        password: { vcenter_password }
        host: { vcenter_hostname_or_ip }
        datacenter_name: { datacenter_name }        
 {{< /highlight >}}   


## vSphere Environment

* You require a working vSphere environment. The plugin was tested with vSphere infrastructure versions 5.5 and 6.0.

## SSH Keys
* You need SSH keys to be generated for both the Manager and the application VM's. If you are using the default key locations in the inputs, you can create them using the following commands:

{{< highlight  bash  >}}
ssh-keygen -b2048 -N "" -q -f ~/.ssh/cloudify-manager-kp.pem
ssh-keygen -b2048 -N "" -q -f ~/.ssh/cloudify-agent-kp.pem
{{< /highlight >}}

## OS Templates

* You need two OS templates for your preferred operating systems (e.g. Ubuntu Trusty) within the vSphere datastores, one for Cloudify Manager and one for the application VMs. The application VM template must accept the Cloudify agent public key for its root user. The Cloudify Manager template must accept the Cloudify Manager public key. Note that you can use same template for both the Manager and the application VMs. In that case, the shared template must accept both public keys.
* Both templates must have SSH activated and open on the firewall.
* Both templates must have VMWare tools installed. Instructions for this can be found on the [VMWare site](http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=2075048). Please note, however, that the instructions on this site provide incorrect tools for importing keys (it should be using `rpm --import <key>` rather than the apt-key equivalent). After following the instructions, run `chkconfig vmtoolsd on`.
* It is also necessary to install the deployPkg plugin on the VM, according to the [VMWare documentation](http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=2075048).
* The template must not have any network interfaces.


# Types

{{% tip title="Tip" %}}
Each type has a `connection_config` property. It can be used to pass parameters for authentication.
{{% /tip %}}


## cloudify.vsphere.nodes.Server

**Derived From:** cloudify.nodes.Compute

**Properties:**

* `server` - The key-value server configuration.
    * `name` - The server name. Note that this MUST NOT contain any characters other than A-Z, a-z, 0-9, hyphens (-), and underscores (_). Underscores are converted to hyphens. It must not be entirely composed of digits (0-9). The name will have a unique suffix appended to it, enabling multiple instances for one node. If the name parameter is not specified, the node name from the blueprint is used, with the same restrictions applying.
    * `template` - The virtual machine template from which the server is spawned. For more information, see the [Misc section - Virtual machine template](#virtual-machine-template).
    * `cpus` - The number of CPUs.
    * `memory` - The amount of RAM, in MB.

* `networking` - The key-value server networking configuration.
    * `domain` - The DNS suffix to use on this server.
    * `dns_servers` - The list of DNS servers.
    * `connect_networks` - The list of existing networks to which the server ise connected, described as key-value objects. The network(s) must be described as:
        * `name` - The name of the port group or distributed port group on vSphere.
        * `management` - Signifies if the network is a management network (`false` by default). Only one connected network can be management. This network has its IP address listed under the `ip` runtime property, but will not otherwise have any impact on how this interface is configured.
        * `external` - Signifies if the network is an external network (`false` by default). Only one connected network can be external. This network is the first network that is attached to the server and has its IP address listed under the `public_ip` runtime property, but does not otherwise have any impact on how this interface is configured.
        * `switch_distributed` - Signifies if the network is connected to a distributed switch (`false` by default).
        * `use_dhcp` - Use DHCP to obtain an IP address (`true` by default).
        * `network` - The network cidr (for example, 10.0.0.0/24). It is used by the plugin only when `use_dhcp` is `false`.
        * `gateway` - The network gateway IP address. It is used by the plugin only when `use_dhcp` is `false`.
        * `ip` - The server IP address. It is used by the plugin only when `use_dhcp` is `false`.

* `connection_config` - The key-value vSphere environment configuration.
    * `username` - The vSphere username.
    * `password` - The user password.
    * `host` - The vCenter host name or IP address.
    * `port` - The vCenter port for SDK (`443` by default).
    * `datacenter_name` - The datacenter name.
    * `resource_pool_name` - The name of a resource pool. If you do not need to use a resource pool, this must be set to `Resources`, as this is the base resource pool on vSphere.
    * `auto_placement` - Signifies whether to use vSphere's auto-placement instead of the plugin's. Must be `true` if you are using clusters. (`false` by default).

**Runtime Properties:**

* `name` - The nme of the server on vSphere and in the OS.
* `ip` - The management IP address of the server (as determined by finding the IP of whichever network is set as `management`), or the IP of the first attached network on the server if no management interface is set. This is `null/None` if there are no attached networks.
* `public_ip` - The external IP address of the server (as determined by finding the IP of whichever network is set as `external`), or `None`if there is no network set as `external`.
* `vSphere_server_id` - The internal ID of the server on vSphere (e.g. vm-1234).
* `networks` - The list of key-value details of the attached networks.
    * `distributed` - Whether this is a distributed network.
    * `name` - The name of this network.
    * `mac` - The MAC address of the NIC on this network.
    * `ip` The IP address assigned to the NIC on this network, or `None` if there is no IP address.

## cloudify.vsphere.nodes.WindowsServer

**Derived From:** cloudify.nodes.Compute

**Properties:**

* `windows_password` - The password to set for the administrator account on the Windows system. If this is not supplied, the value under `properties.agent_config.password` is used. If neither are supplied, an error is raised when running install workflows.

* `windows_timezone` - The timezone to which to set the Windows system. It defaults to `90` (GMT without daylight savings (approximately UTC)). To specify this, it must be set to an [appropriate integer value](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms912391%28v=winembedded.11%29.aspx)

* `windows_organization` - The organization name to set on the Windows system. It defaults to `Organization`.

* `custom_sysprep` - A custom sysprep answers file to use for full customization of Windows. Note that this should be verified to work beforehand, as any errors will only appear on Windows and will not be visible to the plugin. Note also that any scripts, etc, that attempt to work on the VM after the custom sysprep must be tolerant of multiple retries, because the plugin does not detect when the custom sysprep has finished, so provides the server as soon as the IP addresses are assigned (which will be before customization is complete).

* `server` The key-value server configuration.
    * `name` server name. Note that this MUST NOT contain any characters other than A-Z, a-z, 0-9, hyphens (-), and underscores (_, which will be converted to hyphens). It must not be entirely composed of digits (0-9). It is truncated at 8 characters to permit a unique identifier suffix, enabling multiple instances for one node. If the name parameter is not specified, the node name from the blueprint is used, with the same restrictions applying.
    * `template` - The virtual machine template from which the server is spawned. For more information, see the [Misc section - Virtual machine template](#virtual-machine-template).
    * `cpus` - The number of CPUs.
    * `memory` - The amount of RAM, in MB.

* `networking` - The key-value server networking configuration.

        * `name` - The name of the port group or distributed port group on vSphere.
        * `management` - Signifies if the network is a management network (`false` by default). Only one connected network can be `management`. This network has its IP address listed under the `ip` runtime property, but will not otherwise have any impact on how this interface is configured.
        * `external` - Signifies if the network is an external network (`false` by default). Only one connected network can be external. This network is the first network that is attached to the server and has its IP address listed under the `public_ip` runtime property, but does not otherwise have any impact on how this interface is configured.
        * `switch_distributed` - Signifies if the network is connected to a distributed switch (`false` by default).
        * `use_dhcp` - Use DHCP to obtain an IP address (`true` by default).
        * `network` - The network cidr (for example, 10.0.0.0/24). It is used by the plugin only when `use_dhcp` is `false`.
        * `gateway` - The network gateway IP address. It is used by the plugin only when `use_dhcp` is `false`.
        * `ip` - The server IP address. It is used by the plugin only when `use_dhcp` is `false`.

**Node by Node Explanation**

1. Creates a server. In the server, the `networking` property domain name is specified as `example.com`. In addition, the DNS server `8.8.8.8`, and three existing networks to which to connect `example_management_network`, `example_external_network` and `example_network` are specified. In the `server` property, the server name as is specified as `example_server`, and the vm template name as `example_server_template`. The number of CPUs is specified as `1`, and the RAM as `512 MB`.

2. Creates a network. The network name is specified as `example_network`, the network vLAN ID as `101`, and an existing vSwitch name to connect to as `example_vSwitch`.

3. Creates a virtual hard disk. The required storage size is specified as `1 GB` and this storage is added to the `example_server` vm.
