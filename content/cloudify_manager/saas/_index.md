## Overview

Cloudify as a Service is the fastest and easiest way to try Cloudify. You will be getting access to the Cloudify trial managed service which is hosted and managed by Cloudify. Follow the instructions on this page to get your trial account provisioned and gain access to our trial service.

Please note that while the Cloudify service requires no deployment or hardware, if you wish to gain the most from your trial you will need access to some cloud infrastructure (e.g. AWS, Azure, GCP) to integrate with and run your test workloads.

## Step 1: Request a Cloudify as a Service trial account 

To start using Cloudify as a Service, a dedicated account must be created for you. If you have already requested an account and received the details via email please continue to step 2.

Request your Cloudify trial account here

Once you submit the account request form, your request is immediately processed by our system and you should expect an email from the Cloudify team within minutes. Your email will contain an access link to your environment as well as other registration information.

## Step 2: Activate your Cloudify trial and Login 

Follow the link in your email to your dedicated trial management page. This page Shares the account provisioning progress, the trial remaining time, and login information (which is also available in the email you received).

The activation will take place automatically once you click the link. It takes a few minutes to initialize your account and a progress bar will indicate when the account is ready. You will also receive a confirmation email when the account is ready.

Note! Once the activation started it will complete even if you leave the page during the process.

Once initialization is complete, the page content will automatically refresh and share your account details including

- A link to your trial manager login page.
- Your initial login credentials.

Follow the link. Cloudify login page should be displayed.
