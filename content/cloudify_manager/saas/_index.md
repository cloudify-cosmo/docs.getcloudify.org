## Overview

{{< param product_name >}} as a Service is the fastest and easiest way to try {{< param product_name >}}. You will get access to the {{< param product_name >}} trial managed service which is hosted and managed by {{< param product_name >}}. Follow the instructions on this page to get your trial account provisioned and gain access to our trial service.

Please note that while the {{< param product_name >}} service requires no deployment or hardware, if you wish to gain the most from your trial you will need access to some cloud infrastructure (e.g. AWS, Azure, GCP) to integrate with and run your test workloads.

## Step 1: Request a {{< param product_name >}} as a Service Trial Account

To start using {{< param product_name >}} as a Service, a dedicated account must be created for you. If you already requested an account and received the details via email please continue to step 2.

Request your {{< param product_name >}} trial account [here](https://cloudify.co/download/).

Once you submit the account request form, your request is immediately processed by our system and you should expect an email from the {{< param product_name >}} team within minutes. Your email will contain an access link to your environment as well as other registration information.

## Step 2: Activate your {{< param product_name >}} Trial and Login 

Follow the link in your email to your dedicated trial management page. This page shares the account provisioning progress, the trial remaining time, and login information (which is also available in the email you received).

The activation will take place automatically once you click the link. It takes a few minutes to initialize your account and a progress bar will indicate when the account is ready. You will also receive a confirmation email when the account is ready.

Note: Once the activation started it will complete even if you leave the page during the process.
