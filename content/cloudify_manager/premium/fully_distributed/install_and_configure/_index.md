A Cloudify Manager is a compute host running Cloudify components.

- Make sure that your environment meets the prerequisites before you install Cloudify Manager.
- To get started with Cloudify in Amazon AWS, OpenStack or Docker, use a Cloudify Manager image.

You can install the Cloudify CLI on a separate host to manage your Cloudify Manager remotely.
