## Overview
Cloudify Community version can be installed in All-in-One (AIO) mode only. AIO  deployment is based on a single Cloudify box (single VM/Container) running all the Cloudify components, mainly the manager, the database, and the messaging queue.

The Cloudify free community version contains a fully functional Cloudify engine & most of the manager capabilities (read about the differences between our Cloudify versions). The community version is available as an rpm, OpenStack Image, or as Docker image.
