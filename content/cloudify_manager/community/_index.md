## Overview
{{< param product_name >}}'s Community version can be installed in All-in-One (AIO) mode only. AIO  deployment is based on a single {{< param product_name >}} box (single VM/Container) running all the {{< param product_name >}} components, mainly the manager, the database, and the messaging queue.

The {{< param product_name >}} free community version contains a fully functional {{< param product_name >}} engine and most of the manager capabilities (read about the differences between our {{< param product_name >}} versions). The community version is available as an rpm, OpenStack image, or as a Docker image.
