A {{< param cfy_manager_name >}} is a compute host running {{< param product_name >}} components.

# Deploying {{< param cfy_manager_name >}} RPM

{{< param cfy_manager_name >}} RPM file includes all {{< param cfy_manager_name >}} components and their dependencies. The RPM is self-contained, the installation preocess does not require Internet connection.

1. [Download]({{< relref "trial_getting_started/set_trial_manager/other-deployments.md" >}}) the {{< param cfy_manager_name >}} RPM file.

1. Copy the RPM file to your target host.

1. From the terminal of your target host, run:
    ```
    sudo yum install <RPM file path>
    ```
1. Customize [{{< param cfy_manager_name >}}'s settings]({{< ref "cloudify_manager/community/install_and_configure/centos_rhel.md#cfy-manager-configuration" >}}).
1. Install on a single [All-In-One]({{< ref "cloudify_manager/community/install_and_configure/centos_rhel.md#all-in-one-installation" >}}) host
1. {{< param cfy_manager_name >}} is ready for use at `http(s)://<manager_public_address>`


# {{< param cfy_manager_name >}} Configuration {#cfy-manager-configuration}

Once RPM is deployed, file `/etc/cloudify/config.yaml` ([View in GitHub](https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-manager-install/blob/master/config.yaml)) contain all installation options, including:

You can validate the configurations are valid using `cfy_manager validate` command.

## Adding Environment Variables

In certain cases, it may be required to add environment variables to the processes that run {{< param cfy_manager_name >}}.
For example, certain organizations impose restrictions on the installation-default temporary files directory (usually
`/tmp`), requiring the adjustment of the `TEMP` / `TMP` / `TMPDIR` environment variables accordingly.

This can be achieved by providing additional settings in `config.yaml`:

* The `extra_env` key under the `restservice` category contains a dictionary of environment variables to be added
to {{< param product_name >}}'s REST Service.

* The `extra_env` key under the `mgmtworker` category is read as dictionary of environment variables to be added
to {{< param product_name >}}'s Management Workers Service.

For example, to override the `TEMP` environment variable with `/var/tmp`:

```yaml
mgmtworker:
  extra_env:
    TEMP: /var/tmp

restservice:
  extra_env:
    TEMP: /var/tmp
```


## Multi-Network Management

{{< param cfy_manager_name >}} uses [Cloudify Agents]({{< relref "about/manager_architecture/_index.md#cloudify-agents" >}}) to execute tasks and collect information about the resources that it manages. You must specify the {{< param cfy_manager_name >}} IP addresses or DNS names that your agents will use to communicate with it.

{{% note %}}
* You cannot configure multi-network management on [{{< param cfy_manager_name >}} images]({{< relref "cloudify_manager/community/install_and_configure/image.md" >}}).
* If no manager network interface is specified in the blueprint, the agent connects to the `default` interface, which is configured with the `private_ip` flag during the RPM installation process.
{{% /note %}}

Multi-network management can be configured before installing a new Manager and after.

### Option 1: Configure multi-network management before installing a new Manager:

The {{< param cfy_manager_name >}} networks are configured in the `networks` section of the `/etc/cloudify/config.yaml` file, for example:

```yaml
networks:
    default: <privately_routable_ip>
    external: <externally_routable_ip>
```

You must specify the name of the {{< param cfy_manager_name >}} network for each agent that deployed in your [blueprint]({{< ref "cloudify_manager/agents/configuration.md#configuration-properties" >}}) with this syntax:

```yaml
  host:
    type: cloudify.nodes.Compute
    properties:
      agent_config:
        network: external
        install_method: remote
        user: { get_input: username }
        key: { get_secret: agent_key_private }
        port: 22
      ip: { get_input: host_ip }
```

### Option 2: Add  new networks to a running Manager:
* In order to add networks to a running Manager use the `cfy_manager add-networks` command.
* New networks should be supplied as a JSON string. It is possible to add multiple new networks using one command (as shown in the example below).
* Please note that you can only add networks with unique names, otherwise an error will be raised.
* If using a {{< param cfy_manager_name >}} cluster, the command will add the network only for the node it is run on. The command needs to be run separately on each node in the cluster, for the newly-installed agents to be able to contact all nodes in the cluster.
```
cfy_manager add-networks --networks '{"<network-name>": "<ip>", "<network-name>":"<ip>"}'
```


# All In One Installation {#all-in-one-installation}

To install {{< param cfy_manager_name >}}, run:


    cfy_manager install [--private-ip <PRIVATE_IP>] [--public-ip <PUBLIC_IP>] [--admin-password <password>] [-v]


{{% note title="Prerequisites" %}}
The arguments are optional if already configured in `config.yaml` (see [{{< param cfy_manager_name >}}'s settings]({{< ref "cloudify_manager/community/install_and_configure/centos_rhel.md#cfy-manager-configuration" >}}))
{{% /note %}}

# Uninstalling {{< param cfy_manager_name >}}

{{% warning title="Data Loss" %}}
Uninstalling the {{< param cfy_manager_name >}} erases all {{< param product_name >}} data and is irreversible.
{{% /warning %}}

* To uninstall the {{< param cfy_manager_name >}}, run: 
```
sudo cfy_manager remove -f
```

* To remove all of the files that the installation process extracted, run: 
```
sudo yum remove cloudify-manager-install
```
