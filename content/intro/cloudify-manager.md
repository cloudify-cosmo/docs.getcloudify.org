Cloudify enables you to deploy applications using two main methods:

* Using the CLI only
* Using a Cloudify Manager

Cloudify Manager is a dedicated environment comprising an open-source stack which enables you to:

* Utilize plugins (such as Docker, Script, Chef and Puppet plugins) to manage application hosts
* Keep a directory of your blueprints
* Create multiple deployments for each blueprint and install them
* Execute healing, scaling and other custom workflows on your installed applications
* Run multiple workflows concurrently
* View an application's topology and perform different tasks using the Cloudify Web UI
* View metrics 
* Search logs

In addition, Cloudify Manager:

* Provides a secure environment for managing applications via multiple authentication mechanisms and customizable authorization 
* Retains a history of metrics and events
* Manages agents running on an application's host machines

Although you can use Cloudify to provision resources directly from the CLI, use Cloudify Manager to manage production-level applications.

For more information about Cloudify Manager, see the Cloudify Manager section later in this user's guide.
