To start using Cloudify, you must first install it.


# Installing using premade packages

Currently, packages are distributed for Centos 6.5 and 7, RHEL 7 and Windows.

## Windows

To install on Windows:

* Download the installer from the [Downloads page](http://getcloudify.org/downloads/get_cloudify_3x.html) corresponding with the version you would like to install.
* Run the executable installer.
* Follow the installation instructions.
* When the installation is finished, double click the new Cloudify icon on your desktop.

After the installation is complete, try running `cfy -h` in your terminal.


## Linux

To install via rpm packages, you must have Python2.7.x and pip 1.5+ installed and Python2.7.x must be executable as `python` from the path.

### Centos/RHEL

* Download the installer from the [Downloads page](http://getcloudify.org/downloads/get_cloudify_3x.html) corresponding with the version you would like to install.
* Open a terminal at the directory where you downloaded the file.
* Run (replacing `<pkg.rpm>` with the path to the file you downloaded):

{{< gsHighlight  bash  >}}
$ sudo rpm -i <pkg.rpm>
...

$ source /opt/cfy/env/bin/activate
{{< /gsHighlight >}}

After the installation is complete, try running `cfy -h` in your terminal.


# Installing using an installation script

A script is supplied for you to install Cloudify on Linux, Windows and OS X.

## Prerequisites

To install using the script, you must have Python 2.7.x preinstalled.

{{% gsWarning title="Prerequisites Installation" %}}
By default, this script will not install any prerequisites (like pip, or any required compilers). You can supply it with the `--force` flag which will install all prerequisites without prompting you for anything other than a sudoer password (if required).
{{< /gsHighlight >}}

Note that the script requires an internet connection.

Run `python get-cloudify.py -h` for additional information.


## Installation

You can download the script from [here](FIXME)

Then, run `sudo python get-cloudify.py` on Linux or OS X and `python get-cloudify.py` on Windows.

After the installation is complete, try running `cfy -h` in your terminal.


# Which method should I use?

The distributed packages allow for an "offline" installation of Cloudify but do not resolve prerequisites. They should be used if you have no internet connection and would like to install on one of the supported platforms.

The script should be used if you want to install on Debian based distributions and OS X; if you want to choose the version you'd like to install or for development purposes. The script resolves all prerequisites for all platforms.


That's it! Cloudify is installed. You can now try using it to [deploy your first application](intro-getting-started.html).
