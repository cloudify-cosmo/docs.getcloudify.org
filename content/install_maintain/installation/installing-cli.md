## Installing the Cloudify CLI

To remotely connect to Cloudify Manager, you can install the Cloudify Command Line Interface (CLI) on a separate host. The Cloudify CLI includes all of the commands necessary to run any actions on Cloudify Manager.

{{% note title="Manager local CLI" %}}
The CLI is deployed by default on the Cloudify manager. When connected to the manager via SSH, CLI commands can be executed locally without deploying the CLI.

After you download the Cloudify CLI installation package, the installation process does not require an active internet connection.

### Installing on Linux

To install Cloudify CLI on Linux:

1. [Download]({{< relref "/trial_getting_started/set_trial_manager/other-deployments.md" >}}) the installation package for your package management system, either RPM or DEB.

    #### Centos/RHEL
    {{< highlight bash>}}
    $ sudo rpm -i <pkg.rpm>

### Installing on Windows

The Windows installer is a single executable that installs these components:

* Python 2.7.x
* Pip
* Virtualenv
* Cloudify

{{% note title="Installation Note" %}}
If the Python installation shows an error, install make sure that [Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29) is installed.
{{% /note %}}

{{% note title="Installing Python and Pip" %}}
The Python setup wizard prompts you to choose to install pip. If you choose not to install pip, it is installed anyway because it is required by the Cloudify environment.
