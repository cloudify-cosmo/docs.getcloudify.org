A Cloudify Manager is a compute host that runs the Cloudify Management services. To help you get running with Cloudify Manager easily, Cloudify provides images of Cloudify Manager for:

* OpenStack
* Docker

You can create an OpenStack instance with the OpenStack QCOW file, or load a Docker container. Images include pre-installation of Cloudify Manager and its dependencies.

To install Cloudify Manager on bare-metal or other platforms using a single offline RPM package, go to [installing Cloudify Manager]({{< relref "install_maintain/installation/installing-manager.md" >}}).

Make sure that your environment meets the [prerequisites]({{< relref "install_maintain/installation/prerequisites.md" >}}) before you install Cloudify Manager.

## Setup an Instance of a Cloudify Manager Image

1. Go to the [Cloudify download page](http://cloudify.co/download/) and select the Cloudify Enterprise or Community image for your platform.
1. Start the image in your platform:


    * ##### OpenStack

        Go to your OpenStack cloud and launch an instance based on the image you downloaded:

        1. Go to **Compute** > **Images** and click **Create**.
        1. Enter the details of the image, including:
            * Image Source - Select **Image File** and click **Browse File** to browse to the QCOW2 image file.
            * Format - Select **QCOW2**.
        1. Configure the instance resources according to the [prerequisites]({{< relref "install_maintain/installation/prerequisites.md" >}}).
        1. Launch the instance.
        1. To verify that the Cloudify Manager is installed after the instance is created and running, go to the {{< param cfy_console_name >}} at `http://<public_ip>`. Use this IP address as the manager IP address for CLI and {{< param cfy_console_name >}} connections.

    * ##### Docker
        1. Verify that the target computer meets the [prerequisites]({{< relref "install_maintain/installation/prerequisites.md" >}}).
        1. To create and start a Docker container with Cloudify Manager, run:
            {{< highlight bash >}}
docker run --name cfy_manager_local -d --restart unless-stopped \
  -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro --tmpfs /run --tmpfs /run/lock \
  --security-opt seccomp:unconfined --cap-add SYS_ADMIN \
  -p 80:80 -p 5671:5671 -p 53333:53333 \
  cloudifyplatform/premium-cloudify-manager-aio:latest
{{< /highlight >}}
          Or, with a minimal command:
            {{< highlight bash >}}
docker run -d \
  -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro --tmpfs /run --tmpfs /run/lock \
  cloudifyplatform/premium-cloudify-manager-aio:latest
{{< /highlight >}}
          Explanation of commonly used `docker run` flags:

          * `--restart unless-stopped`: auto-restart of the container
          * `security-opt secconmp:unconfined --cap-add SYS_ADMIN` or alternatively `--privileged`: when running a SystemD-based container, giving the container elevated privileges is required for SystemD itself to run. When using a new enough Docker Engine (at least 17.05+), those flags can be omitted, but the host SELinux policy might need to be adjusted by doing `setsebool -P container_manage_cgroup true`. Neither those flags, nor the SELinux adjustment, are required when using containers not based on SystemD.
          * `-v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro --tmpfs /run --tmpfs /run/lock`: mounts required only when using a SystemD-based container. Note that the host machine must also be using SystemD.
          * `-p 80:80 -p 5671:5671 -p 53333:53333` or alternatively `-p 443:443`: the ports 5671 and 53333 are used for manager/agent communication, while the port 80 or 443 is used for CLI/UI access to the manager. Using the `-p` flags, or even `--network host`, those ports can be forwarded from the host machine to the container.
          * `--name cfy_manager_local`: the name given to the container, for use with later `docker exec` calls.
          * `-v /some/absolute/path/to/config.yaml:/etc/cloudify/config.yaml:rw`: mounting a yaml file at `/etc/cloudify/config.yaml` allows configuring the manager container, including setting an admin password, and providing paths to TLS certificates.
        1. The container's starter service will take a while to boot up all the manager components. Run `cfy_manager wait-for-starter` to synchronously wait for the manager to fully start:
            {{< highlight bash >}}
docker exec cfy_manager_local cfy_manager wait-for-starter
{{< /highlight >}}
        When done, `wait-for-starter` will print out the manager's admin password to stdout.

        1. You can change the admin password by running `cfy_manager reset-admin-password`:
            {{< highlight bash >}}
docker exec cfy_manager_local cfy_manager reset-admin-password NEW_PASSWORD
{{< /highlight >}}

        1. To verify that the Cloudify Manager is installed after the instance is created and running, go to the {{< param cfy_console_name >}} at `http://<manager_ip>`, or if the manager's port was bound to the host machine's port using `-p 80:80` or similar, use `http://<host_ip>`. Use this IP address as the manager IP address for CLI and {{< param cfy_console_name >}} connections.

        1. {{< param cfy_console_name >}}'s HTTP port depends on actual Cloudify Manager's configuration.  If you wish [to enable SSL]({{< relref "install_maintain/manager_architecture/security.md#ssl-mode-for-external-communication" >}}), you should also start using `443` port (`-p 443:443` in the `docker run` command) and `https://` protocol for accessing {{< param cfy_console_name >}}.

        1. Activate your license - [Learn more about license activation]({{< relref "install_maintain/installation/manager-license.md" >}})


1. To use Cloudify Manager from the terminal using the [Cloudify CLI]({{< relref "install_maintain/installation/installing-cli.md" >}}), run the following command with your instance details.

    {{< highlight bash >}}
    $ cfy profiles use <manager-ip> -u admin -p admin -t default_tenant
    {{< /highlight >}}

    The default credentials are:

    * username - `admin`
    * password - `admin`

    Because the `cfy` command is already available and configured, you can navigate to Cloudify Manager using SSH and use the already configured CLI environment (except for Docker). You can also install [Cloudify CLI]({{< relref "install_maintain/installation/installing-cli.md" >}}) on a local host and connect to the instance remotely.

1. To change the `admin` password, run:

    {{< highlight bash >}}
    cfy users set-password admin -p <new-password>
    {{< /highlight >}}

1. To update the active CLI profile to use the new password, run:

    {{< highlight bash >}}
    cfy profiles use <manager-ip> -u admin -p <the-new-password> -t default_tenant
    {{< /highlight >}}

## Next Steps

After Cloudify Manager is installed, you can configure your Cloudify Manager for your environment, including:

* [Upload plugins]({{< relref "working_with/official_plugins/_index.md" >}}) to add functionality to Cloudify Manager
* If you intend to use Cloudify to work with LDAP, setup the [LDAP connection]({{< relref "working_with/console/pages/tenant-management-page.md" >}}).
* Build the [secrets store]({{< relref "working_with/manager/using-secrets.md" >}}) for your tenants to store data variables that you do not want to expose in plain text in Cloudify, such as login credentials for a platform.
