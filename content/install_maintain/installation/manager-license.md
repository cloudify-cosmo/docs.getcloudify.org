A new license mechanism was introduced as part of Cloudify 4.6.
From 4.6 on, in order to activate a Cloudify Premium Manager, a valid license is required.
Before the Cloudify Manager is activated, most of the Cloudify REST APIs are blocked, and neither Cloudify CLI nor Cloudify Console is operational.
Cloudify community version does not require a license, hence no activation is needed.
If Cloudify is deployed as a cluster of managers, the license should only be applied once. This should be done through the active manager in that cluster.

# Product Activation

A Cloudify license is provided to all Cloudify Premium subscribed customers by Cloudify support.
Cloudify Premium trial customers receive their trial licnse via email upon trial request.
Request your free 60 day trial at https://cloudify.co/download/#trial.
To activate your Cloudify manager submit your license through either the Cloudify management console (UI) or via the Cloudify CLI.

{{% note title="Activate Permissions" %}}
Only admin users (users with sys_admin system role) are allowed to upload a license and activate the Manager.

## License View

### Cloudify CLI

{{< highlight bash >}}

{{< /highlight >}}

The output of the command would be similar to the following:

{{< highlight bash >}}

## License Expiration

When the license expires, the Cloudify manager will display a notification specifying the new state. 
When using a trial license, upon license expiration, all Cloudify manager functionality will cease until it is updated with a valid license. This means that the REST API, Cloudify CLI and Cloudify Console will not be functional.

* Valid trial license example, edition: 'Spire'
