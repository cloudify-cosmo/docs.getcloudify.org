A Cloudify Manager is a compute host running Cloudify components.

{{% note title="Prerequisites" %}}
* Make sure that your environment meets the [prerequisites]({{< relref "install_maintain/installation/prerequisites.md" >}}) before you install Cloudify Manager.
* To get started with Cloudify in 
OpenStack or Docker, use a [Cloudify Manager image]({{< relref "install_maintain/installation/manager-image.md" >}}).
{{% /note %}}

You can install the [Cloudify CLI]({{< relref "install_maintain/installation/installing-cli.md" >}}) on a separate host to manage your Cloudify Manager remotely.

## Deploying Cloudify Manager RPM

Cloudify Manager RPM file includes all Cloudify Manager components and their dependencies. The RPM is self-contained, the installation process does not require Internet connection.

1. [Download](http://cloudify.co/download/) the Cloudify Manager RPM file.
1. Copy the RPM file to your target host.
1. From the terminal of your target host, run:
    ```
    sudo yum install <RPM file path>
    ```
1. Customize [Cloudify Manager's settings] ({{< relref "install_maintain/installation/installing-manager.md#cloudify-manager-configuration" >}}).
1. Cloudify License can applied [before installation] ({{< relref "install_maintain/installation/installing-manager.md#cloudify-manager-configuration" >}}) or [after installation] ({{< relref "install_maintain/installation/manager-license" >}})
1. Install on a single [All-In-One] ({{< relref "install_maintain/installation/installing-manager.md#all-in-one-installation" >}}) host or [install Cloudify cluster] ({{< relref "install_maintain/installation/installing-cluster.md" >}})
1. Cloudify Manager is ready for use at `http(s)://<manager_public_address>`


## Cloudify Manager Configuration

Once RPM is deployed, file `/etc/cloudify/config.yaml` ([View in GitHub](https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-manager-install/blob/master/config.yaml)) contain all installation options, including:


Setting | Description

 Setting       | Description | Comments |
---------|---------|-------------|
 `admin_password`   | Administrator password       | Recommended. If you do not specify an administrator password in the command-line or the config.yaml file, the installation process generates a random password and shows it as output in the installation logs. |
 `private_ip`;`public_ip`     | Private and public IP addresses    | Can be set in `config.yaml` or as command line argument to `cfy_manager install`        |
 `ssl_enabled` | External REST communications over HTTPS     | Recommended.        |
 `import_resolver` | Local path replacement for remote resources with a URL     |         |
 `ldap` | LDAP connection information     |         |
 `skip_sanity` | Skip sanity check after installation     | Not recommended.        |
 `extra_env` | Additional environment varviables (see below)   |         |
 `ssl_inputs` | SSL communication settings     |         |
 `cloudify_license_path` | Path to Cloudify license file     |         |
 `task_retries` | Maximum number of retries for a task. `-1` means infinite retries | This applies to all workflows. |
 `task_retry_interval` | Minimum wait time (in seconds) between task retries | This applies to all workflows. |



You can validate the configurations are valid using `cfy_manager validate` command.



#### Adding Environment Variables

In certain cases, it may be required to add environment variables to the processes that run Cloudify Manager.
For example, certain organizations impose restrictions on the installation-default temporary files directory (usually
`/tmp`), requiring the adjustment of the `TEMP` / `TMP` / `TMPDIR` environment variables accordingly.

This can be achieved by providing additional settings in `config.yaml`:

* The `extra_env` key under the `restservice` category contains a dictionary of environment variables to be added
to Cloudify's REST Service.

* The `extra_env` key under the `mgmtworker` category is read as dictionary of environment variables to be added
to Cloudify's Management Workers Service.

For example, to override the `TEMP` environment variable with `/var/tmp`:

```yaml
mgmtworker:
  extra_env:
    TEMP: /var/tmp

restservice:
  extra_env:
    TEMP: /var/tmp
```


#### Multi-Network Management

Cloudify Manager uses [Cloudify Agents]({{< relref "about/manager_architecture/_index.md#cloudify-agents" >}}) to execute tasks and collect information about the resources that it manages. You must specify the Cloudify Manager IP addresses or DNS names that your agents will use to communicate with it.

{{% note %}}
* You cannot configure multi-network management on [Cloudify Manager images]({{< relref "install_maintain/installation/manager-image.md" >}}).
* If no manager network interface is specified in the blueprint, the agent connects to the `default` interface, which is configured with the `private_ip` flag during the RPM installation process.
{{% /note %}}

Multi-network management can be configured before installing a new Manager and after.

##### Option 1: Configure multi-network management before installing a new Manager:

The Cloudify Manager networks are configured in the `agent:networks` section of the `/etc/cloudify/config.yaml` file, for example:

```yaml
agent:
  networks:
    default: <privately_routable_ip>
    external: <externally_routable_ip>
  broker_port: 5671
  min_workers: 2
  max_workers: 5
```

You must specify the name of the Cloudify Manager network for each agent that deployed in your [blueprint]({{< relref "install_maintain/agents/configuration.md#configuration-properties" >}}) with this syntax:

```yaml
  host:
    type: cloudify.nodes.Compute
    properties:
      agent_config:
        network: external
        install_method: remote
        user: { get_input: username }
        key: { get_secret: agent_key_private }
        port: 22
      ip: { get_input: host_ip }
```

##### Option 2: Add  new networks to a running Manager:
* In order to add networks to a running Manager use the `cfy_manager add-networks` command.
* New networks should be supplied as a JSON string. It is possible to add multiple new networks using one command (as shown in the example below).
* Please note that you can only add networks with unique names, otherwise an error will be raised.
* If using a Cloudify Manager cluster, the command will add the network only for the node it is run on. The command needs to be run separately on each node in the cluster, for the newly-installed agents to be able to contact all nodes in the cluster.
```
cfy_manager add-networks --networks '{"<network-name>": "<ip>", "<network-name>":"<ip>"}'
```


## All In One Installation

To install Cloudify Manager, run:


    cfy_manager install [--private-ip <PRIVATE_IP>] [--public-ip <PUBLIC_IP>] [--admin-password <password>] [-v]


{{% note title="Prerequisites" %}}
The arguments are optional if already configured in `config.yaml` (see [Cloudify Manager's settings] ({{< relref "install_maintain/installation/installing-manager.md#cloudify-manager-configuration" >}}))
{{% /note %}}


## Additional Resources

* [Upload plugins]({{< relref "working_with/official_plugins/_index.md" >}}) to add functionality to Cloudify Manager
* Manage [tenants and users]({{< relref "working_with/console/tenant-management-page.md" >}}).
* Build the [secrets store]({{< relref "working_with/manager/using-secrets.md" >}}) for your tenants.
    The secrets store lets you store data variables that you do not want to expose in plain text in Cloudify, such as login credentials for a platform.

## Uninstalling Cloudify Manager

{{% warning title="Data Loss" %}}
Uninstalling the Cloudify Manager erases all Cloudify data and is irreversible.
{{% /warning %}}

* To uninstall the Cloudify Manager, run: `sudo cfy_manager remove -f`

* To remove all of the files that the installation process extracted, run: `sudo yum remove cloudify-manager-install`
