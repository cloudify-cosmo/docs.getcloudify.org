A Cloudify Manager is a compute host that runs the Cloudify Management service. For version 4.3 and higher, you can install a single RPM file that installs Cloudify Manager with all of its dependencies. The Cloudify Manager RPM file is self-contained and does not require an internet connection during installation.

{{% note title="Prerequisites" %}}
* Make sure that your environment meets the [prerequisites]({{< relref "install_maintain/installation/prerequisites.md" >}}) before you install Cloudify Manager.
* To get started with Cloudify in Amazon AWS, OpenStack or Docker, use a [Cloudify Manager image]({{< relref "install_maintain/installation/manager-image.md" >}}).
{{% /note %}}

The installation process installs all of the components that Cloudify depends on. You can run the install command again after the initial installation to reinstall and reconfigure the components. The [configure command]({{< relref "install_maintain/installation/installing-manager.md#changing-the-manager-settings" >}}) lets you reconfigure the components without reinstallation. When you install or configure the Cloudify Manager, you can specify the private IP address, public IP address and administrator password as command options, or specify these and other configuration settings in the [config.yaml]({{< relref "install_maintain/installation/installing-manager.md#additional-cloudify-manager-settings" >}}) file.

You can install the [Cloudify CLI]({{< relref "install_maintain/installation/installing-cli.md" >}}) on a separate host to manage your Cloudify Manager remotely.

## Installing Cloudify Manager

The Cloudify Manager is installed from an RPM file. The installation can be customized with command-line flags and the config.yaml file. The [Cloudify Manager installation FAQ](https://cloudify.co/knowledge-base/manager-installation-faq/) includes more information about troubleshooting and advanced scenarios.

{{% note %}}
* If you specify the private and public IP addresses and the administrator password in the config.yaml file, do not specify them in the command options.
* If you do not specify an administrator password in the command-line or the config.yaml file, the installation process generates a random password and shows it as output in the installation logs.
* If you use `-v` for the cfy_manager command, you can see additional debugging logs located at: `/var/log/cloudify/manager/cfy_manager.log`

_To install Cloudify Manager:_

1. [Download](http://cloudify.co/download/) the Cloudify Manager RPM file.
1. Copy the RPM file to your target host.
1. From the terminal of your target host, run:
    ```
    sudo yum install <RPM file path>
    ```
    
    For example: `sudo yum install /home/centos/cloudify-manager-install-4.3.1ga.x86_64.rpm`
1. Configure the Cloudify Manager networks in the [config.yaml]({{< relref "install_maintain/installation/installing-manager.md#additional-cloudify-manager-settings" >}}) file.
1. Review the configuration settings in the `config.yaml` file and make any necessary changes.
1. To install Cloudify Manager, run:
    ```
    cfy_manager install [--private-ip <PRIVATE_IP>] [--public-ip <PUBLIC_IP>] [--admin-password <password>] [-v]
    ```

## Other Installation Actions

### Validating the Installation

When the installation process is complete, you can use `cfy status` to make sure that all of the Cloudify services are running.
Cloudify Premium customers can access the Cloudify Console at:

* By default: `http://<manager_public_address>`
* If you enable SSL in the config.yaml file: `https://<manager_public_address>`

An example output:
{{< highlight  sh >}}
$ cfy status

### Configuring the Manager Settings

After you install Cloudify Manager, you can change the settings used by the installation without reinstalling the Cloudify components. The configure command accepts the same CLI inputs as the install command, and it reads the same config.yaml file for additional settings.

{{% note %}}
* If you specify the private and public IP addresses and the administrator password in the config.yaml file, do not specify them in the command options.
* If you do not specify an administrator password in the command options or the config.yaml file, the installation process generates a random password and shows it as output in the installation logs.
* If you use `-v` for the cfy_manager command, you can see additional debugging logs located at: `/var/log/cloudify/manager/cfy_manager.log`
{{% /note %}}

_To change the Cloudify Manager installation settings:_

1. Edit the [config.yaml]({{< relref "install_maintain/installation/installing-manager.md#additional-cloudify-manager-settings" >}}) file.
1. To configure Cloudify Manager, run:
    ```
    cfy_manager install [--private-ip <PRIVATE_IP>] [--public-ip <PUBLIC_IP>] [--admin-password <password>] [-v]
    ```

### Additional Cloudify Manager Settings

In addition to the command line options, the `/etc/cloudify/config.yaml` ([View in GitHub](https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-manager-install/blob/master/config.yaml)) contains more advanced configuration settings, including:

* Administrator password (`admin_password`)
* Private and public IP addresses (`private_ip`;`public_ip`)
* External REST communications over HTTPS (`ssl_enabled`)
* Local path replacement for remote resources with a URL (`import_resolver`)
* Multi-network management (`networks`)
* LDAP connection information (`ldap`)
* SSL communication settings (`ssl_inputs`)

The `/etc/cloudify/config.yaml` file can be validated at any time using the `cfy_manager validate` command. This performs the same checks that `cfy_manager install` does.

#### Multi-Network Management

Cloudify Manager uses [Cloudify Agents]({{< relref "about/manager_architecture/_index.md#cloudify-agents" >}}) to execute tasks and collect information about the resources that it manages. Before you install your Cloudify Manager, you must specify the Cloudify Manager IP addresses or DNS names that your agents will use to communicate with it.

{{% note %}}
* You must specify the Cloudify Manager networks before you install the Cloudify Manager.
* You cannot configure multi-network management on [Cloudify Manager images]({{< relref "install_maintain/installation/manager-image.md" >}}).
* [Cloudify Examples]( https://github.com/cloudify-examples ) require that the externally-routable network is called `external`.
* If no manager network interface is specified in the blueprint, the agent connects to the `default` interface, which is configured with the `private_ip` flag during the RPM installation process.
{{% /note %}}

The Cloudify Manager networks are configured in the `agent:networks` section of the `/etc/cloudify/config.yaml` file, for example:

```yaml
agent:
  networks:
    default: <privately_routable_ip>
    external: <externally_routable_ip>
  broker_port: 5671
  min_workers: 2
  max_workers: 5
```

You must specify the name of the Cloudify Manager network for each agent that deployed in your [blueprint]({{< relref "install_maintain/agents/configuration.md#configuration-properties" >}}) with this syntax:

```yaml
  host:
    type: cloudify.nodes.Compute
    properties:
      agent_config:
        network: external
        install_method: remote
        user: { get_input: username }
        key: { get_secret: agent_key_private }
        port: 22
      ip: { get_input: host_ip }
```

### Security Recommendations

For security considerations, we recommend that you:

* Specify an administrator password according to your security policy
* Set SSL in the config.yaml file to `enabled`
* Set gunicorn to bind to localhost
    To set gunicorn to listen on localhost only:
    1. Edit the `/usr/lib/systemd/system/cloudify-restservice.service` file.
    1. Find this line: `-b 0.0.0.0:${REST_PORT} \`
    1. Replace the line with: `-b localhost:${REST_PORT} \`
    1. To restart the dependent services, run:
        ```
        sudo systemctl daemon-reload
        sudo systemctl restart cloudify-restservice
        ```

### Adding Environment Variables

In certain cases, it may be required to add environment variables to the processes that run Cloudify Manager.
For example, certain organizations impose restrictions on the installation-default temporary files directory (usually
`/tmp`), requiring the adjustment of the `TEMP` / `TMP` / `TMPDIR` environment variables accordingly.

This can be achieved by providing additional settings in `config.yaml`:

* The `extra_env` key under the `restservice` category contains a dictionary of environment variables to be added
to Cloudify's REST Service.

* The `extra_env` key under the `mgmtworker` category is read as dictionary of environment variables to be added
to Cloudify's Management Workers Service.

For example, to override the `TEMP` environment variable with `/var/tmp`:

```yaml
mgmtworker:
  extra_env:
    TEMP: /var/tmp

restservice:
  extra_env:
    TEMP: /var/tmp
```

### Additional Cloudify Console Settings

You can customize Cloudify Console by [modifying userConfig.json file]({{< relref "working_with/console/_index.md#advanced-configuration" >}}).

### Emptying the Cloudify Manager Database

{{% warning title="Data Loss" %}}
Emptying the Cloudify Manager database erases Cloudify data and is irreversible.
{{% /warning %}}

During both installation and configuration of Cloudify Manager, you can use the `--clean-db` option to empty all of the data from the Cloudify Manager database. The initial installation does not require the `--clean-db` flag.

### Uninstalling Cloudify Manager

{{% warning title="Data Loss" %}}
Uninstalling the Cloudify Manager erases all Cloudify data and is irreversible.
{{% /warning %}}

* To uninstall the Cloudify Manager, run: `sudo cfy_manager remove -f`

* To remove all of the files that the installation process extracted, run: `sudo yum remove cloudify-manager-install`

## Next Steps

After Cloudify Manager is installed, you can configure your Cloudify Manager for your environment, including:

* [Upload plugins]({{< relref "working_with/official_plugins/_index.md" >}}) to add functionality to Cloudify Manager
* To use Cloudify with LDAP users, setup the [LDAP connection]({{< relref "working_with/console/tenant-management-page.md" >}}).
* Build the [secrets store]({{< relref "working_with/manager/using-secrets.md" >}}) for your tenants.
  
    The secrets store lets you store data variables that you do not want to expose in plain text in Cloudify, such as login credentials for a platform.
