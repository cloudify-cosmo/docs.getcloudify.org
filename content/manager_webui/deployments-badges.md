When executing a `Workflow` for a `Deployment` (e.g. the `install` workflow), the topology nodes show badges that reflect the workflow execution state.<br/>
See more details on executing workflows [here]({{< field "execute_workflow_link" >}}#topology).<br/>

## Badges

* Install state - The workflow execution is in progress for this node
* Done state - The workflow execution was completed successfully for this node
* Alerts state - The workflow execution was partially completed for this node
* Failed state - The workflow execution failed for this node
