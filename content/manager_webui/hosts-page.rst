Nodes Page
%%%%%%%%%%


The ``Nodes`` page displays a list of all the nodes that are related to
a ``Deployment``.

[Nodes Overview]({{< img “ui/ui-nodes-overview.png” >}})

| ##Filtering Data You can filter the nodes data in the table by:
| \* Deployed Blueprint \* Deployments \* Types \* Free text search

You can use more than one filter to focus your view. The page updates
dynamically as you make your selections.

**To filter ``Deployed Blueprints``, ``Deployments``, and ``Types``**\ 
Select one or more items from the relevant dropdown list. \* The
``Deployments`` list is affected by the selections that you make in the
``Deployed Blueprints`` list. If the ``Deployed Blueprints`` selection
consists only of undeployed blueprints, the ``Deployments`` list is not
displayed. If the blueprint on which a deployment is based is not
selected in the ``Deployed Blueprints`` list, that deployment will not
appear in the ``Deployments`` list. If you do not select any
deployments, it is equivalent to selecting all deployments in the list.

**To filter by free text**\  You can free type text in the **Free Text**
field. The displayed data automatically changes to match the filter. All
fields in the table are included in the free text search.
