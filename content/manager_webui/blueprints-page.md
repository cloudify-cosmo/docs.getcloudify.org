# In-depth Information about a Blueprint
When you click the name of a blueprint in the table, a blueprint-specific dialog opens. The dialog includes three tabs with details about the selected blueprint:<br>
* Topology
* Nodes
* Source

## Topology
The **Topology** tab displays an applicationâ€™s graph of nodes and their relationships, which describes the lifecycle events or other operations that each node and relationship exposes for use in workflows.<br>
Each of the blueprint's nodes is displayed as a square container that can contain other nodes. Each node has a name, and an icon to indicate the [node type]({{< relref "blueprints/spec-node-types.md" >}}).<br>
[Relationships]({{< relref "blueprints/spec-relationships.md" >}}) between nodes are indicated with arrows that starts at the connected node and end at the target node.<br>
The topology tab shows only the application nodes and not the network nodes. If a node has a network dependency, it is displayed as a bullet icon in the node's title.<br>
The number of node instances is marked in a bullet beside the node's type icon.<br>
