Dashboard Page
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The Dashboard page is the landing page when you log into the Cloudify
Web interface.

By default, the page displays the most commonly used widgets, including
the number of deployments, plugins and node instances that are being
managed by this Cloudify Manager. In addition, other widgets provide an
overview of the current and recent processes related to Cloudify
Manager.

The widgets that appear on this page and their position on the page are
fully customizable by an ``admin`` user, as with other pages.

If you are an ``admin`` user, you have the option of enabling other
users to customize pages by toggling the **Configure** option in the
dropdown menu adjacent to your user name.
