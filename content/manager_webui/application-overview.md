The Application page is the landing page when you log into the Cloudify Web interface. 

By default, the page displays the most commonly used widgets, including the number of deployments, plugins and servers that are being managed by this Cloudify Manager. In additon, other widgets provide an overview of the current and recent processes related to Cloudify Manager.

The widgets that appear on this page and their position on the page are fully customizable by an `admin` user, as with other pages. 

If you are an `admin`, you have the option of enabling other users to customize pages by toggling the **Configure** option in the dropdown menu adjacent to your user name.
