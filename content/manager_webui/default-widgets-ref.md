This section provides a description of all the widgets that are included by default in Cloudify Manager (out-of-the-box). You can select these widgets from the widgets catalog. 

To view the widgets catalog, from the dropdown menu next to your user name, select **Edit Mode**, then click the **Add Widget** button to display the list of widgets. If you do not see Edit mode in the dropdown menu, you do not have permissions to edit configuration. 


For information about adding widgets, placing them on a page, and so on, see [Configuring the Web Interface Display]({{< relref "manager_webui/configure-display.md" >}}).

**Notes:**<br>

* You might have to configure some of the widgets. In the event that configuration is mandatory, the mandatory requirements are included in the widget descriptions. Many widgets also have non-mandatory configuration that enables you to customize them to your requirements.   

   To open a widget's configuration dialog after you have added it to a page, click the gear icon in the top right of the widget.

* Some widgets are only available for `admin` users. 


The widgets are listed according to their category.

## Blueprint Widgets

### Blueprint Sources
Displays all the sources in a blueprint package in tree view, adjacent to the code. When you click an item in the tree, its code is displayed in the code panel.

![blueprint-sources]({{< img "ui/widgets/blueprint-sources.png" >}})

### Blueprint deployments
Displays the list of a deployments in the current tenant, according to the logged-in user's permissions. The data can be displayed as a table or list. In the case of a list view, the status of each deployment is also displayed. For information about deployment status, [click here]({{< relref "manager_webui/deployments-page.md" >}})

![blueprint-deployments]({{< img "ui/widgets/blueprint-deployments.png" >}})

### Blueprint info
Displays information about a specific blueprint.

#### Configuration
The blueprint ID must be passed to the widget. This can be done either in the page's context, by placing the widget in a blueprint drill-down page, or by specifying the blueprint ID in the widget's configuration.

![blueprint-info]({{< img "ui/widgets/blueprint-info.png" >}})

### Blueprints

Displays all the local blueprints on the Cloudify Manager in the context of the current tenant as a table or tile view, according to the logged-in user's permissions. In the catalog view, each blueprint entry includes the icon PNG file with which it was uploaded or the Cloudify default icon if no PNG file was attached.

#### Configuration
In the widget configuration dialog, you can toggle on the **Click to drill down** option so that, when the blueprint is clicked, the drill down page is displayed for that blueprint.

![blueprints-list]({{< img "ui/widgets/blueprints-list.png" >}})

### Blueprints Catalog

Displays the details of a blueprint that exists in a repository under a Github user that has been specified in the widget's settings, as a table or tile view. The widget provides an `upload` option for each of the blueprints, enabling them to be easily uploaded locally to the Manager.

You can create a filter query in the configuration to specify the blueprints that appear. 

![blueprints-catalog]({{< img "ui/widgets/blueprints-catalog.png" >}})



## Deployment Widgets

### Deployment Inputs

Displays the blueprint input values. You can hover over the values, to display them in a separate window, which is useful if the values include multi-line code.

![deployment-inputs]({{< img "ui/widgets/deployment-inputs.png" >}})

### Deployment Outputs

Displays the blueprint output values. You can hover over the values, to display them in a separate window, which is useful if the values include multi-line code.

![deployment-outputs]({{< img "ui/widgets/deployment-outputs.png" >}})

### Deployment Metric Graph
Displays a graph presenting metric data for the current deployment. After you have added the widget to a page, you can select the metrics to be displayed, and define their properties in the widget's configuration dialog. 


#### Configuration

You must supply the deployment's ID, either in the page context, or by specifying it in the widget configuration.

The following list provides information regarding some of the other parameters that can be specified for this widget. 


* `Refresh Time Interval` - How frequently the data in the widget is refreshed (in secs).
* `Deployment ID` - The ID of the deployment for which you want to display data. The ID can be passed in two ways:   
   
   * As part of the page's context. For example, if you add the graph widget to the deployment drill-down page, in order to access the graph widget you must first choose a deployment from the deployments page. In that case, the drilled-down page already contains the context of the deployment you chose, so the widget automatically retrieves the Deployment ID from it. 
   * If a Deployment ID was not provided by the pageâ€™s context, the widget looks for a specific Deployment ID to be provided in its configuration Deployment ID field.
* `Metric` - The specific Diamond metric you want the widget to display. For more information about these metrics, see the [Diamond documentation](http://diamond.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The available options are:   
   * `Cpu_total_system`
   * `Cpu_total_uer`
   * `memory_MemFree`
   * `memory_SwapFree`
   * `Loadavg_processes_running`
   
* `Time Range Start` - Enables you to specify the timeframe of the metrics to be displayed. You can select `Last 15 minutes`, `Last hour`, or `Last Day`.
* `Time Range End` - You can select `Now` to define the end of the metrics display timeframe.
* `Time Resolution Value` - Enables you to group the metrics according to time, to reduce the volume of displayed data. For example, although data might be collected every 10 msecs, you might specify that you only see points on the graph for every minute. For more information, see the [Influx documentation](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v0.8/api/query_language/#group-by).
* `Time Resolution Unit` - The time resolution at which data is displayed, for example minutes or seconds. 
* `Database Query` - By default, the query is based on deployment ID, metric name, time filter and resolution. You can paste your own query, which will then be used to fetch data. For example   
   ```
    select mean(value) from /deployment-id'\\..*\\metric/  where time > now()-1h  and time <now() group by time(1m)  order asc
    ```

* `Graph Type` - Select either a line graph or bar chart display.
* `Graph Label` - The label to be displayed for the graph.
