Cloudify Web interface pages are comprised of widgets. Widgets are dynamic data units that show up to date information.<br>
You can select which widgets you want to see on each page, and can configure the widgets.

Default pages provide views of the most commonly required data. With the exception of the Application page, you can delete these pages or add your own.

**Sorting Data**<br>
You can sort data in table-style widgets by clicking on a column header. 

**Viewing Additional Data**<br>
You can click on data in most widgets, to drill down to additional context-sensitive information.
