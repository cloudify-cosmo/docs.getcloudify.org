Cloudify Web interface pages are comprised of widgets. Widgets are dynamic data units that show up to date information. You can select which widgets you want to see on each page, and can configure the widgets. Default pages provide views of the most commonly required data. You can delete these pages, or add your own.

This section provides the following information:

* Adding widgets
* Configuring widgets
* Adding pages

## Opening Edit Mode

To make configuration changes, you must enter Edit mode. <br>
Click the dropdown arrow next to your user name and select **Edit Mode**.<br>

Note that the **Add Widget** button appears below your user name. In addition, you can now drag and drop widgets on the page by clicking and holding on their title bar. You can also remove them from the page by clicking the **X** in the right corner of the widget (visible when hovering over the widget's title bar), or click the widget configuration button.

## Adding Widgets

A catalog of widgets is available to enable you to select your preferred data display on any page.

1. In Edit mode, click **Add Widget**.
2. Select the widget that you want to add and click **Add**.   
   You can enter free text in the search box to find a widget.

 The widget appears on the page. You can drag and drop it in the position that you prefer.

 ## Configuring Widgets

 1. In Edit mode, hover over the title bar of the widget you want to configure and click the gear icon (({{<img "ui/gear-icon.png">}})).
 2. Make your required changes and click **Save**.   
    The available fields are widget-specific.
