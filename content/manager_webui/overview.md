The Cloudify Web interface is provided to Premium customers and requires a Cloudify Manager to run. It provides most features available in the command-line interface and more.

In additon to being able to upload blueprints, create deployments and execute workflows, the interface provides metrics visualization, log and events views, application and network topology visualization, and more.

The Cloudify Web interface provides a streamlined experience for managing and analyzing your applications.

##Logging In

You can bootstrap Cloudify Manager with or without security configuration. If you have enabled ecurity support, the interface redirects users to the Login screen.<br>
Users must enter their `Username` and `Password`, and can select the `Remember me` option.<br>
The name of the logged in user is displayed in the top-right of the window.

To log out, click the logout button next to your name, as shown in the following screen capture.

##Hot Keys

The Web interface includes multiple hot key shortcuts that you can use to perform the primary actions available in the interface. Hot key shortcuts include actions such as navigating pages; uploading, deleting and deploying a blueprint, executing a workflow, deleting and updating a deployment, and so on.

Use the `?` key to display a context-sensitive list of hotkeys. For example, the keys available on the blueprints page are shown in the following screen capture.
