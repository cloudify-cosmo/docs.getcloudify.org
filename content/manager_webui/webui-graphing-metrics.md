# Overview

Cloudify's Monitoring Implementation uses [Grafana]({{page.grafana}}) for tracking system metrics.
The monitoring section can be found on each deployment's page in the user interface:
![The monitoring section button](images/ui/ui-monitoring-tab.jpg)

Once you open the monitoring section you can find a default dashboard with six graphs.
You can also customize your dashboard however you want and save it on a JSON file or in your browser's local storage.

### Default Dashboard:

The default dashboard is a set of graphs that Cloudify will initialize if a dashboard doesn't already exist.
The presented common system metrics are a good start from which you can further customize your dashboard.
The default dashboard includes the following metrics:

* CPU Utilization - System
* CPU Utilization - User
* Physical Memory
* Disk IO
* Network IO - RX
* Network IO - TX


# Setting up your blueprint for metrics collection and shipping

The Default dashboard will display metrics only if the blueprint is configured to ship metrics corresponding with the default dashboard's configured view.

For an example of an already configured blueprint, go to [cloudify-nodecellar-example]({{page.cloudify_nodecellar_example}}).


# Example - Customize your dashboard

To start customizing your graph, click on the panel's title and then 'Edit' to open a panel in edit mode:
![The monitoring panel edit mode](images/ui/ui-monitoring-title-edit.jpg)

Under the edit mode, you can edit or add new metrics under 'metrics' section:
![The monitoring panel edit mode of metrics](images/ui/ui-monitoring-edit-metrics.jpg)

To change the title / span / height of the panel click on 'General' in edit mode:
![The monitoring panel general edit mode](images/ui/ui-monitoring-edit-general.jpg)

To change the axes and grid of the panel click on 'Axes & Grid' in edit mode:

To change colors and styles of the panel click on 'Display Styles' in edit mode:
