# Overview
When clicking on the `Hosts` tab, you will be able to view all the hosts that are related to a `Deployment`:<br/>
![Hosts Overview]({{< img "ui/ui-hosts-overview.png" >}})


You can control which hosts are displayed by filtering by:

# Blueprints

![Blueprints]({{< img "ui/ui-hosts-blueprints-selection.png" >}})

# Deployments

This list is affected by the selection of blueprints. <br/>
If the blueprints selection consists only of undeployed blueprints, this dropdown will not be visible.<br/>
Likewise, it will not include a deployment if the blueprint it is based on wasn't selected.<br/>
Not selecting any deployments is equivalent to selecting all deployments in the list.<br/>
![Deployments]({{< img "ui/ui-hosts-deployments-selection.png" >}})

# Applying the filter
This page is not filtered live. You should click on the `Show` button to apply the filter.<br/>
![Show]({{< img "ui/ui-hosts-show.png" >}})

And the filter results is displayed
![Show Results]({{< img "ui/ui-hosts-show-results.png" >}})

# Search hosts
This page allows live search of the hosts list.<br/>
As you type in the search box, the items in the hosts list will be updated to reflect the search criteria.<br/>
*Note, that all fields of the table are searched*
![Search]({{< img "ui/ui-hosts-search.png" >}})
