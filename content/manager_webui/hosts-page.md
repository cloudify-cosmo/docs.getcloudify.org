# Overview
When clicking on the `Hosts` tab, you will be able to view all the hosts that are related to a `Deployment`:<br/>
![Hosts Overview](images/ui/ui-hosts-overview.png)


You can control which hosts are displayed by filtering by:

# Blueprints
See the definition [here]({{page.terminology_link}}#blueprint).<br/>
![Blueprints](images/ui/ui-hosts-blueprints-selection.png)

# Deployments
See the definition [here]({{page.terminology_link}}#deployment).<br/>
This list is affected by the selection of blueprints. <br/>
If the blueprints selection consists only of undeployed blueprints, this dropdown will not be visible.<br/>
Likewise, it will not include a deployment if the blueprint it is based on wasn't selected.<br/>
Not selecting any deployments is equivalent to selecting all deployments in the list.<br/>
