Hotkeys
%%%%%%%

The Web UI has multiple hotkey shortcuts, used to perform all of the
primary actions available in the UI. Actions such as navigating pages,
uploading, deleting and deploying a blueprint, executing a workflow,
deleting and updating a deployment and much more.

Be sure to hit the ``?`` key to check the hotkeys available to you
depending on the page you are at.

For example, available hotkeys at the blueprints page:

[Example hotkeys]({{< img “ui/ui-hotkeys.png” >}})
