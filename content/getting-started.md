# Before You Begin

Also, you need to have an IaaS environment (a cloud) and credentials to complete the following section.

If you hadn't already installed Cloudify's CLI, now would be the time to do so. To install the CLI, follow the steps described in the [CLI Installation guide](installation.html). The CLI allows you to upload blueprints, create deployments, and execute workflows, as well as many other useful functions. For more information on the CLI's functions check the [CLI Reference](cli-cfy-reference.html).

Finally, it is recommended that you try the [Quick Tutorial](quickstart.html) first to familiarize
yourself with Cloudify and its concepts.

# Getting Started with Cloudify

Cloudify comprises three distinct entities:

* a command-line interface (the client)
* a manager (the brain)
* agent(s) (the workers)

This Getting Started section will walk you through writing your first Cloudify Blueprint and testing it on your local environment using Cloudify's CLI. You will then bootstrap a Cloudify Manager in the Cloud of your choosing which will allow you to intall your Blueprint on that Cloud Environment. During execution, agents will be installed on the provisioned machines.

Once everything up and and runnning, we will show you how to tear down the entire thing.

{{% gsNote title="Actionable" %}}
Each step in the Getting Started section is called an `Actionable` - which means that now is a part of the guide in which you take action.
All other information is descriptive Cloudify context.

By the way, you can choose to bootstrap Cloudify on one of the following IaaS providers:

  - [OpenStack](plugin-openstack.html)
  - [Softlayer](plugin-softlayer.html)
  - [AWS EC2](plugin-aws.html)
  - [vCloud](plugin-vsphere.html)

The blueprint you'll be deploying describes a nodejs application that connects to a MongoDB database and presents a wine catalog.


# What's Next

First, verify that you have met the [prerequisites for bootstrapping](getting-started-prerequisites.html).
