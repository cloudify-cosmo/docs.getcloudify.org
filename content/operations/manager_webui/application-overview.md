The Dashboard page is the landing page when you log into the Cloudify Web interface. 

![Delete blueprint]( ./images/manager/dashbord1.png )

By default, the page displays the most commonly used widgets, including the number of deployments, plugins, and node instances on this Cloudify Manager.
The other default widgets show an overview of the current and recent processes on the Cloudify Manager, including:

* All of the executions on the Cloudify manager.
* All of the logs on the Cloudify manager.
    You can configure these widgets to show executions for a specific blueprint or deployment.

Admin users can customize this page and all pages, including which widgets are shown and their position on the page.

If you are an `admin` user, you can toggle the **Configure** option in the dropdown menu next to your user name to let other users customize pages.
