The Web UI has multiple hotkey shortcuts, used to perform all of the primary actions available in the UI. Actions such as navigating pages, uploading, deleting and deploying a blueprint, executing a workflow, deleting and updating a deployment and much more.

Be sure to hit the `?` key to check the hotkeys available to you depending on the page you are at.

For example, available hotkeys at the blueprints page:


![Example hotkeys]({{< img "ui/ui-hotkeys.png" >}})
