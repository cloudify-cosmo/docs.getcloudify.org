In this section we will talk about our javascript client and show how you can overcome CORS problems and use it to build your own UI.
Read our <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudifyjs.gsdev.info/3.2.0/index.html" target="_blank">technical documentation</a> for more information.

For using the javascript client from frontend, you will need to setup CORS manually.
Read below to see how.

# NodeJS Client

To use this client run the command `npm install cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-js#3.2.0 --save`

Here is an example of how to get blueprints

{{< highlight  js  >}}

var CloudifyClient = require('cloudify-js').CloudifyClient;

var client = new CloudifyClient({'endpoint' : 'http://cloudify.localhost.com'});
var logger = require('log4js').getLogger('index.nodejs');

client.blueprints.list(null, function( err, response, body){
logger.info('this is body',body);
});

For more examples on how to use in front end please read the official javascript documentation


# JavaScript Client - How to enable CORS

If you wish to use the cloudify javascript client, you will run into CORS issues.

CORS happens when you generate requests from one origin (protocol + domain + port) to another.

However you can easily configure your nginx server to enable CORS for you while keeping your network safe.


{{< highlight   text  >}}
location ^/restapi {
  add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' 'customui.example.com';
  add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials' 'true';
  add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods' 'GET, POST, OPTIONS';
  add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers' 'DNT,X-Mx-ReqToken,Keep-Alive,User-Agent,X-Requested-With,If-Modified-Since,Cache-Control,Content-Type';

  proxy_pass http://manager.example.com;
}

{{< /highlight >}}

The example above references 2 origins. The first is `customui.example.com` which is the domain you serve your UI from.
The second, `manager.example.com` is cloudify's manager host that you have set up earlier.

You need to replace these 2 values with the ones that suite you best.

We begin with `location /restpi` which means this rule will only affect routes that begin with `/restapi`.
you need to change this value according to your client's configuration.
Our example suites the following use case:

`var client = new CloudifyClient({'endpoint' : 'http://customui.example.com/restapi'});`

We then start to add headers to add cross origin requests which will resolve the problem.

The configuration ends with the line `proxy_pass http://manager.example.com;`. This line is responsible for the calls actually reaching the cloudify manager.

{{% tip title="Using a wild card" %}}

You can also replace `customui.example.com` with `*`

This means that every website can write javascript that has access to your cloudify manager.

This might be the right use case for you, it is also easier to use to see first results,
however using it when it is not your use-case opens a security breach and is not recommended so make sure not to leave it open
 on your production environment
