Cloudify enables you to create your own widgets to help you to orchestrate your applications in the Cloud.


## Widget Development Methods

### Language

We write our widgets in JavaScript. They can be created using:

1. **ReactJS** is the recommended method and requires a build operation. 
You must use the build system described in [Building]({{< relref "developer/custom_console/custom-widgets.md#building" >}}) section.
Code must be compatible with [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) v16.x. ES6 is supported in that method.

2. **Plain JavaScript** enables you to attach an HTML template file. The callbacks for this method are described later in this topic. 
You must create a widget package yourself. No ES6 is supported in that method.

 
### Building

To ease widget building, you should use one of the following environments:

1. [Widget Development Environment](https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/Cloudify-UI-Widget-boilerplate) - it's quick to set it up, but you'll have to upload your widget to Cloudify Manager after every code change.
2. [Cloudify Console Development Environment](https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-stage) - it takes more time to set it up, but once you have it configured, you won't need to upload your widget to Cloudify Manager after every change in widget's code, because building tools running in background would update it for you.  

You can find environment configuration description under above mentioned links. 


## Widget Directory

A widget is made up of these files:

File          | Required | Description
------------- | -------- |  -----------
`widget.js`   | Yes      | Holds the [widget definition]({{< relref "developer/custom_console/custom-widgets.md#widget-definition" >}})
`widget.png`  | Yes      | The preview image of the widget in the widgets catalog
`backend.js`  | No       | A widget backend that allows widget frontend code to use [backend services]({{< relref "developer/custom_console/custom-widgets.md#widget-backend" >}})
`widget.html` | No       | A widget template file that is relevant only when you write a widget in plain JavaScript with an HTML template
`widget.css`  | No       | The CSS file that the widget uses
`README.md`   | No       | A widget help ReadMe file in [Markdown format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)

Let's say you want to create a widget `my-widget`. 

### ReactJS

If you want to write your widget in **ReactJS** (recommended), you must put your `widget.js` file 
(and optionally `backend.js` file) into the `src` directory along with any other required files. 
In the `widget.js` file, you can use `import` to include the additional files. 
You can split the widget into a number of files. You can also use ES6 features. 

In this method, the widget directory structure will look as follows:
```
/widgets   
   /my-widget   
      /src   
         widget.js
         backend.js   // Optional
      widget.js       // File generated by build system
      backend.js      // Optional. File generated by build system
      widget.html     // Optional
      widget.png
      widget.css      // Optional
      README.md       // Optional
```

### Plain JavaScript

If you use **Plain JavaScript** the widget directory structure looks like this:
```
/widgets   
   /my-widget
      widget.js
      backend.js   // Optional
      widget.html  // Optional
      widget.png
      widget.css   // Optional
      README.md    // Optional
```


## Widget Definition

Each `widget.js` file must have a call to the `Stage.defineWidget` global function. 

### Example 

The following code demonstrates how easy it is to create a simple widget. 
You can copy this code and put it in a `widget.js` file to produce a fully working widget. 
See the previous section for the directory structure guidelines.

```javascript
Stage.defineWidget({
    id: 'my-widget',
    name: 'My Widget',
    description: 'This widget displays "Hello World!" text',
    isReact: true,
    categories: [Stage.GenericConfig.CATEGORY.OTHERS],
    permission: Stage.GenericConfig.CUSTOM_WIDGET_PERMISSIONS.CUSTOM_ALL,

    render: function(widget, data, error, toolbox) {
        return (
            <span>Hello World!</span>
        );
    }    
});
```


### Widget Settings
 
As seen in the example above, there are some configuration fields that you can provide when you design a widget. 

The `Stage.defineWidget` function receives a settings object with the options described in this table.

Option                 | Type    | Required | Default      | Description
----------             | -----   | -------- | ------------ | -----------
`categories`           | array   | No       | `['Others']` | This property specifies in which categories this widget is shown. It can take an array containing one or more of the values defined in `Stage.GenericConfig.CATEGORY` object: `BLUEPRINTS` ('Blueprints' category), `DEPLOYMENTS` ('Deployments'), `BUTTONS_AND_FILTERS` ('Buttons and Filters'), `CHARTS_AND_STATISTICS` ('Charts and Statistics'), `EXECUTIONS_NODES` ('Executions/Nodes'), `SYSTEM_RESOURCES` ('System Resources'), `OTHERS` ('Others'), `ALL` ('All').
`color`                | string  | No       | `blue`       | The color of the widget. One of the following: `red`, `orange`, `yellow`, `olive`, `green`, `teal`, `blue`, `violet`, `purple`, `pink`, `brown`, `grey` or `black`.
`description`          | string  | No       | -            | Description of the widget that is displayed in the **Add Widget** dialog.
`fetchUrl`             | string/object | No | -            | If `fetchUrl` exists, the data from the URL is fetched by the application and passed to the render and postRender methods. To fetch multiple URLs, you must pass an object where the key is a name you select for this data, and the value is the URL. It is important to note that the render is called once before the data is fetched (to enable information about loading or partial data can be displayed) and once after the data is fetched.
`hasReadme`            | boolean | No       | `false`      | Whether to use `README.md` file. File must be present in widget's main directory. If `helpUrl` is defined and `hasReadme` is set to `true`, then `helpUrl` is used.
`hasStyle`             | boolean | No       | `false`      | Whether to use `style.css` file. File must be present in widget main directory.
`hasTemplate`          | boolean | No       | `false`      | Whether to use `widget.html` file as template. File must be present in widget main directory.
`helpUrl`              | string  | No       | -            | URL to help webpage. If `helpUrl` is defined and `hasReadme` is set to `true`, then `helpUrl` is used.
`id`                   | string  | Yes      | -            | The ID of the widget definition. Must match the name of the directory into which it is placed.
`initialConfiguration` | array   | No       | `[]`         | A list of widget configuration options. The options are displayed when a user clicks the **`Configure`** icon in the top-right corner of the widget in edit mode. 
`initialHeight`        | string  | No       | `12`         | The default height of the widget when added to a page.
`initialWidth`         | string  | No       | `3`          | The default width of the widget when added to a page.
`isReact`              | boolean | No       | `true`       | Set as `true` when writing a React widget.
`name`                 | string  | Yes      | -            | The display name of the widget that is displayed in the **Add Widget** dialog. It is also used as the default widget name.
`showBorder`           | boolean | No       | `true`       | Whether to display border of the widget.
`showHeader`           | boolean | No       | `true`       | Whether to display a header. If a header is not displayed, a user cannot change the widget name.
`permission`           | string  | No       | `CUSTOM_ALL` | This property specifies which user can later access and view this widget. It can take one of the following three values defined in `Stage.GenericConfig.CUSTOM_WIDGET_PERMISSIONS` object: `CUSTOM_ADMIN_ONLY` (applies for 'sys_admin' and 'manager' roles), `CUSTOM_SYS_ADMIN_ONLY` (applies for 'sys_admin' only, `CUSTOM_ALL` (applies to all user-roles).


#### initialConfiguration

`initialConfiguration` supports 4 generic pre-made configuration fields:

* `Stage.GenericConfig.POLLING_TIME_CONFIG(int)` - How often to refresh the data (in seconds)
* `Stage.GenericConfig.PAGE_SIZE_CONFIG(int)` - The initial number of rows (page size) for widgets presenting data in tabular view. If value not provided, then page size is set to 5
* `Stage.GenericConfig.SORT_COLUMN_CONFIG(string)` - Column name to sort by
* `Stage.GenericConfig.SORT_ASCENDING_CONFIG(boolean)` - Change sorting order (true=ascending)

In addition to listed above, you can create your own configuration fields. Example of configuration with user-defined fields:

```javascript
    initialConfiguration: [
        Stage.GenericConfig.PAGE_SIZE_CONFIG(3),
        {id: 'username', name: 'Fetch with', placeHolder: "GitHub user", description: "...", default: "cloudify-examples", type: Stage.Basic.GenericField.STRING_TYPE},
        {id: 'filter', name: 'Filter', placeHolder:"GitHub filter", description: "...", default: "blueprint in:name NOT local", type: Stage.Basic.GenericField.STRING_TYPE},
        {id: "displayStyle", name: "Display style", items: [{name:'Table', value:'table'}, {name:'Catalog', value:'catalog'}], default: "catalog", type: Stage.Basic.GenericField.LIST_TYPE},
        Stage.GenericConfig.SORT_COLUMN_CONFIG('created_at'),
        Stage.GenericConfig.SORT_ASCENDING_CONFIG(false)
    ]
```

Full list of available configuration field types (value of `type` property) you can in the [GenericField component documentation]({{< relref "developer/custom_console/widgets-components.html" >}})).

Configuration fields values can be fetched in `render` method using `widget.configuration` object. See [Accessing data in render()]({{< relref "developer/custom_console/custom-widgets.md#accessing-data-in-render" >}}) for details.


#### fetchUrl

There are two primary ways of pulling data from remote sources: `fetchUrl` and `fetchData()`.

`fetchUrl` is an object member and may be defined either as a string or an object with multiple string properties (*property:URL*) where each property represents a separate URL to query.

##### Single URL

A single URL results are available directly in the *data* object.

```javascript
fetchUrl:  'localhost:50123/public/nodes'
// ...
render: function(widget, data, error, toolbox) {
    let your_data = data;
    //...
}
```

##### Mulitple URL

In case `fetchUrl` is defined with multiple URLs, the results are accessible by the property name of this URL (i.e. *data.nodes*).

```javascript
fetchUrl: {
    nodes: '[manager]/nodes?_include=id,deployment_id,blueprint_id,type,type_hierarchy,number_of_instances,host_id,relationships,created_by[params:blueprint_id,deployment_id,gridParams]',
    deployments: '[manager]/deployments?_include=id,groups[params:blueprint_id,id]'
}
// ...
render: function(widget, data, error, toolbox) {
    let nodes = data.nodes.items;
    let deployments = data.nodeInstances.items; 
    //...
}
```

As seen in the example above, URLs provided in `fetchUrl` can be parametrized with several special tokens:
```javascript
fetchUrl: '[manager]/executions?is_system_workflow=false[params]'
```

* The `[manager]` token is replaced with the current Cloudify Console backend IP address and call is forwarded to Cloudify Manager's REST API.
* The `[backend]` token is replaced with the current Cloudify Console backend IP address.
* The `[params]` token, on the other hand, is quite special. This placeholder can be expanded into a number of things depending on usage:
    * `[params]` alone anywhere in the URL is expanded to default pagination parameters (`_size`, `_offset`, `_sort`) if available (see `initialConfiguration`).
     This mode is **inclusive** - all params available in the widget is appended to URL.
    * `[params:param_name1(,param_name2)]` is replaced with "&paramName1:paramValue1" in the URL.
     Please note that this can be used both to selectively pick pagination parameter as well as custom parameters (see `fetchParams()`).
      This mode is **exclusive** - parameters not specified explicitly are skipped.
      When using selective param picking (`[params:param_name]`) you can use a pre-defined `gridParams` tag to include all pagination parameters (`_size`, `_offset`, `_sort`) instead of specifying explicitly  each of the three.


##### fetchUrl - Inclusive Params 

The following example illustrates *fetchUrl* with both tokens along with their URL:

```javascript
initialConfiguration: [
    Stage.GenericConfig.POLLING_TIME_CONFIG(60),
    Stage.GenericConfig.PAGE_SIZE_CONFIG(),
    Stage.GenericConfig.SORT_COLUMN_CONFIG('column_name'),
    Stage.GenericConfig.SORT_ASCENDING_CONFIG(false)
],
fetchUrl: {
    nodes: '[manager]/nodes[params]'
},
fetchParams: function(widget, toolbox) {
    return {
        sampleFuncParam: 'dummy'
    }
}
```

**Result URL:** http://<MANAGER_IP>/sp/?su=/api/v3.1/nodes?&_sort=-column_name&_size=5&_offset=0&sampleFuncParam=dummy

This url can be divided into 3 separate parts:

Field           | Example                                 | Description
---             | ---                                     | ---
manager address | http://<MANAGER_IP>/sp/?su=/api/v3.1/   | The internal value of Cloudify Manager `[manager]`
endpoint name   | nodes?                                  | Remaining part of the REST endpoint address
generic params  | &_sort=-column_name&_size=5&_offset=0   | Parameters that were implicitly added to request. These parameters are inferred from the GenericConfig objects in initialConfiguration and are responsible for pagination of the results. It is possible to omit them by explicitly specifying param names to be used like so `[params:my-param]`. Alternatively, gridParams (sort, size, offset) can be simply removed from `initialConfiguration`.
custom params   | &sampleFuncParam=dummy                  | Custom parameters can be defined in `fetchParams()` function. Each custom parameter must be returned as a property of an Object returned by `fetchParams()` function.

##### fetchUrl - Exclusive Params 

The same URL, this time with explicit param names (and the `gridParams` tag):

```javascript
initialConfiguration: [
    Stage.GenericConfig.POLLING_TIME_CONFIG(60),
    Stage.GenericConfig.PAGE_SIZE_CONFIG(),
    Stage.GenericConfig.SORT_COLUMN_CONFIG('column_name'),
    Stage.GenericConfig.SORT_ASCENDING_CONFIG(false)
],
fetchUrl: {
    nodes: '[manager]/nodes[params:sampleFuncParam,gridParams]'
//  which is essentially the same as
//  nodes: '[manager]/nodes[params:sampleFuncParam,_size,_offset_,_sort]'
},
fetchParams: function(widget, toolbox) {
    return {
        sampleFuncParam: 'dummy'
    }
}
```
**Result URL:** http://<MANAGER_IP>/sp/?su=/api/v3.1/nodes?&sampleFuncParam=dummy&_sort=-column_name&_size=5&_offset=0


### Widget Functions

The following functions are available to be defined for custom widgets (they must be provided as properties of object passed to `Stage.defineWidget` function).


#### init()

Called when the widget definition is loaded, which occurs after the system is loaded. 
Can be used to define certain elements, for example classes and objects that are used in the widget definition.


#### render(widget, data, error, toolbox)

Called each time that the widget needs to draw itself. 
This can occur when the page is loaded, widget data is changed, context data is changed, widget data is fetched, and so on. 

`render` parameters are:

* The [widget object]({{< relref "developer/custom_console/custom-widgets.md#widget-object" >}}) itself
* The fetched data, either using `fetchUrl` or `fetchData`. The data is `null` if `fetchData` or `fetchUrl` is not specified. 
The data will also pass `null` to the `render` method until data is fetched. If you are expecting data, you can render a "loading" indicator.
* The error if data fetching failed
* The [toolbox object]({{< relref "developer/custom_console/custom-widgets.md#toolbox-object" >}}).

`render()` is focal to the appearance of the widget as the return value of this function is rendered by ReactJS engine.
As such it is important to understand how to build widgets. 

The following example illustrates the simplest usage:

```javascript
render: function(widget, data, error, toolbox) {
    return (
        <span>Hello World!</span>
    );
}
```

You can learn how to render ReactJS elements and components starting from [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html).


##### Using Ready Components In render()

Although using [React DOM Elements](https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html) (similar to plain HTML tags) gives you extreme flexibility, 
usually it is much quicker to design your widget with the use of Cloudify Console ready-made components.
These components were designed with Console uniformity and ease-of-use in mind, and as are very easy to learn and use.

The following example illustrates how to use a `KeyIndicator` component:

```javascript
render: function(widget, data, error, toolbox) {
    let {KeyIndicator} = Stage.Basic;
    
    return (
        <KeyIndicator title='User Stars' icon='star' number={3} />
    );
}
```

Notice that the `KeyIndicator` component is imported into the widget. It is defined in the render method as: 
```
let {KeyIndicator} = Stage.Basic;
```

You can also import multiple components in the same line, for example: 
```
let {KeyIndicator, Checkmark} = Stage.Basic;
```

Description of other built-in components is available [here]({{< relref "developer/custom_console/widgets-components.html" >}}).


##### Accessing Data In render()

There can be several independent data sources for your widget. 
Two most commonly used are the `configuration` and `data` objects.
The following example illustrates how to access both of them:

```javascript
Stage.defineWidget({
    id: 'my-widget',
    name: 'My widget',
    description: 'This widget polls data from two different sources',
    isReact: true,
    initialConfiguration: [
        {id: 'confText', name: 'Conf Item',  placeHolder: 'Configuration text item', default: 'Conf text', type: Stage.Basic.GenericField.STRING_TYPE}
    ],
    permission: Stage.GenericConfig.CUSTOM_WIDGET_PERMISSIONS.CUSTOM_ALL,

    fetchData: function(widget, toolbox, params) {
        return Promise.resolve({fetchedText: 'Fetched text'});
    },

    render: function(widget, data, error, toolbox) {
        let {Loading} = Stage.Basic;

        if (_.isEmpty(data)) { // Make sure the data is already fetched, if not show a loading spinner
            return (<Loading message='Loading data...'></Loading>);
        } else {  
            return (
                <div>
                    <p>confItem value: {widget.configuration.confText}</p>
                    <p>fetchedText value: {data.fetchedText}</p>
                </div>
            );
        }
    }
});
```

The above widget will display two lines containing the strings defined in the data sources: "Conf text" and "Fetched Text".
Please note how the widget makes sure data has been loaded has completed before rendering it. 
Skipping this check would result in an error in browser console.

Default value of `initialConfiguration` fields, as the name suggests, is only used if there are no user defined values for these properties.
A user can change them by entering the **Edit Mode** where he can modify widget's configuration. 
From that point, the current widget will use the value provided by the user.
To reset it to it's default value, the widget must be removed and re-added to the page.

Moreover, please remember to remove and re-add the widget to the dashboard if changing the `initialConfiguration` field. 
It is only loaded for newly 'mounted' widgets.


#### postRender(container, widget, data, toolbox)

**Non-React widgets only.**

`postRender` is called immediately after the widget has been made visible in the Console. 
This function has access to the same objects as the `render` function with one addition - 
the `container` object containing a reference to the widget's container (parent) object.


#### fetchData(widget, toolbox, params)

An alternative to using `fetchUrl` is the `fetchData()` function. It provides greater flexibility when you need to pre-process 
your results or chain them into nested Promises (ie. pull a list of URLs and resolve each of those URLs).
 
`fetchData()` parameters are:

* [widget object]({{< relref "developer/custom_console/custom-widgets.md#widget-object" >}})
* [toolbox object]({{< relref "developer/custom_console/custom-widgets.md#toolbox-object" >}})
* params object (see [fetchParams() function]({{< relref "developer/custom_console/custom-widgets.md#fetchParams(widget,-toolbox)" >}}))

The return value for `fetchData()` is expected to be a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise). 
As such if you would like to return a primitive value you would need to wrap it in a promise:

```javascript
fetchData: function(widget, toolbox, params) {
    return Promise.resolve({key:value});
}
```

Please note that should the result be a single primitive value you still need to return it as a property of an Object, 
since referencing the Object directly is illegal in ReactJS. With this in mind, the following example would not work:

```javascript
// THIS WILL NOT WORK
fetchData: function(widget, toolbox, params) { 
    return 10; 
},

render: function(widget, data, error, toolbox){ 
    return (
        <div>
            {data}  // This will produce a runtime error
        </div>
    )
}
```

Instead, you can return the `int` value as a property of the object like so:

```javascript
fetchData: function(widget, toolbox, params) { 
    return {myInt: 10}; 
},
render: function(widget, data, error, toolbox) { 
    return (
        <div>
            {data.myInt}  // OK
        </div>
    )
}
```

**Note**: `fetchUrl` and `fetchData()` are mutually exclusive, 
that is if you define `fetchUrl` in your widget, then `fetchData()` definition is ignored.


#### fetchParams(widget, toolbox)

`fetchParams()` function delivers query parameters to 

* `fetchData()` - can be accessed using `params` argument of the function,
* `fetchUrl` - can be accessed using `[params]` wildcard in URL.

Example for `fetchUrl`:

```javascript
fetchUrl: '[manager]/nodes[params]',
fetchParams: function(widget, toolbox) {
    let deploymentId = toolbox.getContext().getValue('deploymentId');

    return {deployment_id: deploymentId};
}
```


Example for `fetchData()`:

```javascript
fetchData: function(widget, toolbox, params) {
    return toolbox.getManager().doGet('/nodes', params);
},
fetchParams: function(widget, toolbox) {
    let deploymentId = toolbox.getContext().getValue('deploymentId');

    return {deployment_id: deploymentId};
}
```


## Widgets APIs

The widget development tools include built-in features, widget objects, functions, templating mechanism and available libraries.


### Widget Object

The `widget` object has the following attributes:

Attribute   | Description
---------   |  -----------
`id`        | The ID of the widget
`name`      | The display name of the widget (the widget definition name is the default name for the widget, but a user can change it in **Edit Mode**)
`height`    | The height of the widget on the page
`width`     | The width of the widget on the page
`x`         | The _x_ location of the widget on the page
`y`         | The _y_ location of the widget on the page
`definition`| The widget definition object as it was passed to `defineWidget` method. All widget definitions are contained in the widget definition object. The only additional field that the widget can access is `template`, which is fetched from the HTML and added to the widget definition.


### Toolbox Object

The `toolbox` object enables widget to communicate with the application and other widgets. 
It also provides generic tools that the widget might require.

The `toolbox` object provides access to the following:

* Utility classes:
  * `Context` - see `getContext()` method
  * `EventBus` - see `getEventBus()` method

* HTTP Requests classes:
  * `External` - see `getExternal(basicAuth)` method
  * `Internal` - see `getInternal()` method
  * `Manager` - see `getManager()` or `getNewManager(ip)` methods
  * `WidgetBackend` - see `getWidgetBackend()` method

Hierarchy of the HTTP Requests classes is presented below: 

![External class hierarchy]( /images/ui/customWidgets/External-class-hierarchy.png )

#### drillDown(widget, defaultTemplate, drilldownContext)

Function used to drill down to a specific page. 


##### Parameters

###### widget

It's [widget object]({{< relref "developer/custom_console/custom-widgets.md#widget-object" >}}). It is used to define drill down action originator. 
Widget's ID is used during drill down page URL creation.


###### defaultTemplate

When you drill down to a page, you must pass the [drilldownTemplate]({{< relref "developer/custom_console/custom-widgets.md#drilldown-page-templates" >}}) name. 
When a widget is on a page and you use the drilldown action (for example, in a link click event to a button) 
for the first time to access the page, the app creates a new page based on the passed template. 
When this page is created, the user can edit it like any other page. Each time the user accesses this page, the existing page is shown.

`defaultTemplate` is used during drill down page URL creation.


###### drilldownContext

You can also pass a `drilldownContext` to the drilldown page. This context is saved on the URL and is available through the app context. 
This value is persistent, so if a user drills down to a page and then refreshes the page, the context is saved. 
For example, with the selected deployment in drilldown deployment page.

When selecting a deployment we drill down to a deployment page. It looks like this:

```javascript
    _selectDeployment(item) {
        this.props.toolbox.drillDown(this.props.widget, 'deployment', {deploymentId: item.id});
    }
```

You can see an example of the "deployment" template (used in the example) in the Cloudify Console 
repository in the [/pages/deployment.json](https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-stage/blob/master/templates/pages/deployment.json) file.


##### Drilldown Page Templates

Drilldown page templates are defined in the [/templates/pages](https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-stage/blob/master/templates/pages) directory. 

Each file contains one page template configuration.

Page template configuration has a name which is the default page name, and list of widgets. 
Each widget have the following fields

field         | description
---           | ---
name          | Widget default name
definition    | The ID of the widget to use
width         | The initial width of the widget on the page
height        | The initial height of the widget on the page
x             | The initial x location of the widget on the page
y             | The initial y location of the widget on the page
configuration | The initial configuration of the widget (**Optional**)

If x and/or y are not defined the page is auto arranged (not recommended)

For example:
```json
{
  "name": "template-name",
  "widgets": [
    {
      "name": "Deployments",
      "definition": "deployments",
      "width": 12,
      "height": 24,
      "x": 7,
      "y": 35,
      "configuration": {
        "displayStyle":"list"
      }
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```


#### getContext() 
A widget context gives access to the application context. Using the context we can pass arguments between widgets, 
for example when a blueprint is selected, set the context to the selected blueprint, 
and all the widgets that can filter by blueprint can read this value and filter accordingly.

The context supports these methods:

* `setValue(key, value)` - sets value in context
* `getValue(key)` - returns value from context

#### getEventBus()
 
Used to register (listen to) and trigger events. The event bus is used to enable a widget to broadcast an event, 
usually a change that it made that affect others. For example, if a blueprints widget creates a new deployment, 
other widgets need to be aware that the the deployment list has changed. The listening widgets then call a `refresh`. 
`Event bus` supports the following methods:

* `on (event, callback, context)`
* `trigger (event)`
* `off (event, offCallback)`   
      
For example:
```javascript
componentDidMount() {
    this.props.toolbox.getEventBus().on('deployments:refresh', this._refreshData, this);
}
componentWillUnmount() {
    this.props.toolbox.getEventBus().off('deployments:refresh', this._refreshData);
}
_deleteDeployment() {
    // Do somehting...
    actions.doDelete(deploymentToDelete).then(() => {
        this.props.toolbox.getEventBus().trigger('deployments:refresh');
    }).catch((err) => {
        // Handle errors...
    });
} 
```


#### getExternal(basicAuth) 

Used to access external URLs allowed by Cloudify Console. To access other external URLs, 
you should use [Widget backend]({{< relref "developer/custom_console/custom-widgets.md#widget-backend" >}}) feature.

If you provide `basicAuth` parameter, then in all HTTP requests 'Authorization' header is set with 'Basic <basicAuth>' value.  
   
Available methods:

```javascript
doGet(url, params, parseResponse, headers)
doPost(url, params, data, parseResponse, headers, withCredentials)
doDelete(url, params, data, parseResponse, headers)
doPut(url, params, data, parseResponse, headers)
doPatch(url, params, data, parseResponse, headers)
doDownload(url, fileName)
doUpload(url, params, files, method, parseResponse=true)
```

Parameters:

* `url` - string, containing URL
* `params` - object, query string parameters passed in object, eg. `{myParam: 'myValue'}`
* `data` - object, request body 
* `parseResponse` - boolean, if set to true, then response is parsed to JSON
* `headers` - object, headers to be passed to request, eq. `{"authentication-token": "jfcSvxDzy8-Fawsie"}` 
* `fileName` - name of the file for the downloaded file

{{% note %}}
We recommend that you use `fetchData()` instead of `doGet(URL, params)` since `fetchData()` not only utilizes `doGet()` but also gives easy access to helper params.
{{% /note %}}


#### getInternal()

Returns `Internal` object (all capabilities of `External` object described above) to make internal HTTP requests on secured connection. 
URLs passed to Internal object methods are prepended with context path: `/console`. 

To all requests the following headers are added:

* **Authentication-Token** header with current token value,
* **tenant** header with current selected tenant name.


#### getManager()

Returns `Manager` object (extends capabilities of `Internal` object described above). 

Used either to make HTTP requests (see `External` object methods above) to Cloudify Manager REST API or to read Manager's properties:

Cloudify Manager REST API HTTP request example:

```javascript
return this.toolbox.getManager().doDelete('/deployments/${blueprint.id}');

doUpload(blueprintName, blueprintFileName, file) {   
    return this.toolbox.getManager().doUpload('/blueprints/${blueprintName}',
                                              _.isEmpty(blueprintFileName) 
                                                ? null   
                                                : {application_file_name: blueprintFileName+'.yaml'},
                                              file);
}
```

Cloudify Manager REST API documentation can be found [here]({{< relref "developer/apis/rest-service.html" >}}).
As you can see in the above example in URL parameter you don't have to provide `/api/vX.X` portion. 

Available methods for getting Cloudify Manager properties:

```javascript
getIp()
getCurrentUsername()
getManagerUrl(url, data)
getApiVersion()
getSelectedTenant()
doGetFull(url, params, parseResponse, fullData, size)
```

#### getNewManager(ip)

Returns `Manager` object connected on the specified IP. 

May be needed in order to join a different manager (eg. for cluster joining).


#### getWidgetBackend()

Returns `WidgetBackend` object (all capabilities of `Internal` object described above). 

It allows you to make HTTP requests on previously defined widget backend endpoints 
(see [Widget backend]({{< relref "developer/custom_console/custom-widgets.md#widget-backend" >}}) section for details). 


#### getWidgetDefinitionId

Returns widget ID (see [widget object]({{< relref "developer/custom_console/custom-widgets.md#widget-object" >}})).


#### goToHomePage

Redirects user to home page.


#### goToPage(pageName)

Redirects user to page with ID (URL alias) passed in `pageName` argument.


#### goToParentPage

Redirects user to parent page (used when you are in drill-down page).


#### loading(boolean)

Shows/hides a loading spinner in widget header. 

**Not allowed in `render()` and `postRender()`** methods as it changes store state leading to `render()` and `postRender()` re-run.


#### refresh()

If we did some actions in the widget that require fetching the data again (for example we added a record) we can ask the app to refresh only this widget by calling refresh().

### Stage global object

There is `Stage` global object available, it can be accessed from widgets code.

#### Stage.Basic object

It contains basic React components. Many [Semantic-UI-React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) components are exposed using that object. 
Detailed documentation about content can be found in [Widget Components API Reference]({{< relref "developer/custom_console/widgets-components.html" >}}).

#### Stage.Common object

It contains constants, functions and React components shared between built-in widgets. This API can change.

To see what is exposed in latest version see source code: [common widget folder](https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-stage/tree/master/widgets/common/src).

#### Stage.Utils object

It contains utility functions shared between built-in widgets and main application. 
They are related to execution, JSON, time and URL handling.

To see what functions are available in latest version see source code: [main file](https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-stage/blob/master/app/utils/stageUtils.js) and [shared folder](https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-stage/tree/master/app/utils/shared).


### External Libraries

The external libraries available to a widget are: `React`, `PropTypes`, `moment`, `jQuery`, `Lodash` and `markdown-js`.

You can assume that the following names are globally available as they are attached to the browser window object:

**React** - [react library](https://github.com/facebook/react)
You can use React API, e.g for creating refs or context.
React library is already loaded, so you don't have to import it.
 
for example:
```javascript
export default class PagesList extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);

        this.pagesRef = React.createRef();
    }
    // ...
}
```

**PropTypes** - Runtime type checking for React props and similar objects. [prop-types library](https://github.com/facebook/prop-types)

for example:
```javascript
export default class SideBar extends Component {
    static propTypes = {
        homePageId: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
        pageId: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
        isEditMode: PropTypes.bool.isRequired,
        isOpen: PropTypes.bool
    }
    // ...
}
```  

**moment** - Date/Time parsing utility. [Moment documentation](http://momentjs.com/docs/)

for example:
```javascript
var formattedData = Object.assign({},data,{
    items: _.map (data.items,(item)=>{
        return Object.assign({},item,{
            created_at: moment(item.created_at,'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss.SSSSS').format('DD-MM-YYYY HH:mm'),
            updated_at: moment(item.updated_at,'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss.SSSSS').format('DD-MM-YYYY HH:mm'),
        })
    })
});
```

**jQuery** - Feature-rich JS library. [jQuery API](http://api.jquery.com/)

for example:
```javascript
function postRender(el,widget,data,toolbox) {
    $(el).find('.ui.dropdown').dropdown({
        onChange: (value, text, $choice) => {
            context.setValue('selectedValue',value);
        }
    });
}
```

**Lodash** - Modern JavaScript utility library delivering modularity, performance & extras. [Lodash documentation](https://lodash.com/docs)

for example:
```javascript
_.each(items, (item)=>{
    //...
});
```

**markdown-js** - JavaScript Markdown parser. [markdown-js documentation](https://github.com/evilstreak/markdown-js)
            
for example:
```javascript
let content = "An h1 header\n" +
              "============\n" +
              "\n" +
              "Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.\n" +
              "\n" +
              "2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, and `monospace`. Itemized lists\n" +
              "look like:\n" +
              "\n" +
              "  * this one\n" +
              "  * that one\n" +
              "  * the other one\n";
let readmeContent = markdown.parse(content);
```


### Widget Backend

With widget backend support user can create HTTP endpoints in Console backend. They allow to define specific actions when endpoint is called. There can be used helper services not available in widget frontend.


#### Security Aspects

- Endpoint is accessible only from the widget which created that endpoint.
- Access to external libraries can be limited to preconfigured set of libraries. 


#### Defining Endpoints

To create endpoint per widget you need to create `backend.js` file with at least one endpoint definition. That file must be placed in widget main folder similarly to `widget.js` file. 


##### `backend.js` file structure

Example of `backend.js` file is presented below:

```javascript
module.exports = function(r) {

    r.register('manager', 'GET', (req, res, next, helper) => {
        let _ = require('lodash');
        let jsonBody = require('body/json');
        let url = req.query.endpoint;
        let params = _.omit(req.query, 'endpoint');
        let headers = req.headers;

        jsonBody(req, res, function (error, body) {
            helper.Manager.doPost(url, params, body, headers)
                .then((data) => res.send(data))
                .catch(next);
        })
    });
}
```

`backend.js` file should export a function taking one argument (`r` in example). This function's body contains calls to register method (`r.register` in example). Each call registers HTTP endpoint in the backend.

Syntax of `register` method:

```javascript
function register(name, method, body)
```
where

* `name` - String with HTTP endpoint name on which service is registered,
* `method` - String with HTTP endpoint method on which service is registered,
* `body` - Function (`function(req, res, next, helper)`) to be called on request to this endpoint, where:
    * `req, res, next` - Part of middleware function (see [Using middleware @ ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html) for details) 
    * `helper` - JSON object containing [Helper services]({{< relref "developer/custom_console/custom-widgets.md#helper-services" >}}).


##### Helper Services

In this section helper services, which can be used from `helper` object in endpoints body are described. 


###### Manager

Available methods:

* `call(method, url, params, data, headers={})` - Performs HTTP request to Cloudify Manager
* `doGet(url, params, headers)` - Performs HTTP GET request to Cloudify Manager
* `doPost(url, params, data, headers)` - Performs HTTP POST request to Cloudify Manager
* `doDelete(url, params, data, headers)` - Performs HTTP DELETE request to Cloudify Manager
* `doPut(url, params, data, headers)` - Performs HTTP PUT request to Cloudify Manager
* `doPatch(url, params, data, headers)` - Performs HTTP PATCH request to Cloudify Manager

where:

* `method` - HTTP methods (allowed methods: 'GET', 'POST', 'DELETE', 'PUT', 'PATCH')
* `url` - Manager REST API URL (eg. `blueprints`, see [Cloudify REST API documentation](http://docs.getcloudify.org/api) for details)
* `params` - JSON object with URL parameters (key is parameter name, value is parameter value, eg. `{param1: 'value1', param2: 'value2'}`) (**Optional**) 
* `data` - JSON object with request body (**Optional**)
* `headers` - JSON object with request headers (**Optional**) 


###### Request

Available methods:

* `call(method, url, params, data, parseResponse=true, headers={})` - Performs HTTP request
* `doGet(url, params, parseResponse, headers)` - Performs HTTP GET request
* `doPost(url, params, data, parseResponse, headers)` - Performs HTTP POST request
* `doDelete(url, params, data, parseResponse, headers)` - Performs HTTP DELETE request
* `doPut(url, params, data, parseResponse, headers)` - Performs HTTP PUT request
* `doPatch(url, params, data, parseResponse, headers)` - Performs HTTP PATCH request

where:

* `method` - HTTP methods (allowed methods: 'GET', 'POST', 'DELETE', 'PUT', 'PATCH')
* `url` - HTTP URL (eg. `http://example.com`)
* `params` - JSON object with URL parameters (key - parameter name, value - parameter value, eg. `{param1: 'value1', param2: 'value2'}`) (**Optional**)
* `data` - JSON object with request body (**Optional**)
* `parseResponse` - boolean value informing if response shall be parsed as JSON (**Optional**)
* `headers` - JSON object with request headers (**Optional**)  


#### Calling Endpoints

Previously defined endpoints can be accessed in widget frontend using `toolbox.getWidgetBackend()` method (see [getWidgetBackend()]({{< relref "developer/custom_console/custom-widgets.md#getWidgetBackend()" >}}) for details).

Example of calling endpoint *status* with GET method `widget.js`:
```javascript

Stage.defineWidget({
    // ... all stuff necessary to define widget ...

    fetchData: function(widget, toolbox, params) {
        return toolbox.getWidgetBackend().doGet('status')
            .then((data) => Promise.resolve({status: data}))
            .catch((error) => Promise.reject('Error fetching status. Error: ' + error));
    },

    render: function(widget,data,error,toolbox) {
        let status = data ? data.status : 'unknown';
        return (
            <p>
                Status: <b>{status}</b>
            </p>
        );
    }
});
```

The *status* endpoint for GET method must be defined in `backend.js` file:
```javascript
module.exports = function(r) {
    r.register('status', 'GET', (req, res, next, helper) => {
        res.send('OK');
    });
}
```


### Widget Template

The widget template is an html file written with [lodash template engine](https://lodash.com/docs/4.15.0#template).
 
Widget template if fetched when the widget definition is loaded, and its passed to the render function. To access it use widget.definition.template.
To render the template using the built in lodash templates engine use `_.template(widget.definition.template)(data);`, where 'data' is any context you want to pass on to the template.
For example, a simple render function looks like this:

```javascript
render: function(widget,data,toolbox) {
    if (!widget.definition.template) {
        return 'missing template';
    }
    return _.template(widget.definition.template)();
}
```
