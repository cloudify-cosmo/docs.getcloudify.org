The infrastructure provisioning basics examples demonstrate the basic concepts of Cloudify by orchestrating a simple infrastructure setup consisting of a VM with its basic peripherals (Security group, network, etc.). Each example is designed to match a different IaaS (infrastructure as a service) with examples for AWS, Azure, GCP and OpenStack.

Running these examples and going through the tutorial you will be learning the concept of blueprints, plugins, deployment, secret store and more.
