This section will introduce you to {{< param product_name >}} through a series of example use cases. These use cases range from a simple, "Hello World" deployments to complex multicloud orchestration workflows. These examples require a working {{< param cfy_manager_name >}}. If you do not have your manager installed, please refer to the [{{< param cfy_manager_name >}} setup]({{< relref "/trial_getting_started/set_trial_manager/_index.md" >}}) before moving on.

The following guides will walk you through the basic concepts of {{< param product_name >}} orchestration by running example scenarios designed to match common required use cases and explain {{< param product_name >}} best practices and proper service design. It is recommended to start with Level One and make your way through the order of the examples; the more advanced examples expect some knowledge gained in earlier levels.

Below is a short video demonstrating the first examples. You can start with a quick review or go directly to the example descriptions below.
