OK, so you have your Cloudify manager setup ready and now it is time to run your first orchestration tasks.
If you do not have your manager installed, please refer to the [Cloudify Manager setup]({{< relref "/trial_getting_started/set_trial_manager/_index.md" >}}) before moving on.

This section will walk you through the basic concepts of Cloudify orchestration by running example scenarios designed to match common required usecases and explain Cloudify best practices and proper service design.
It is recommended to start with level one and make your way through the order of the examples; the more advanced examples expect some knowledge gained in earlier levels.
