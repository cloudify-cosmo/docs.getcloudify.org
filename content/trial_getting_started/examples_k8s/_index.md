OK, so you have your {{< param cfy_manager_name >}} setup ready. Let's start using {{< param product_name >}} to orchestrate Kubernetes!
If you do not have your manager installed, please refer to the [{{< param cfy_manager_name >}} setup]({{< relref "/trial_getting_started/set_trial_manager/_index.md" >}}) before moving on.

This section will walk you through the basic concepts of {{< param product_name >}} orchestration by running example scenarios designed to match common required usecases and explain {{< param product_name >}} best practices and proper service design.
It is recommended to start with level one and make your way through the order of the examples; the more advanced examples expect some knowledge gained in earlier levels.

<!-- Here is a short video demonstrating the first examples. You can start with a quick review or go directly to the example descriptions below.
