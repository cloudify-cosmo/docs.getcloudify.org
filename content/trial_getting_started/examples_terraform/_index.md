Terraform and the {{< param cfy_manager_name >}} are a great duo and these examples will show you how easy and powerful it is to use them together. 
If you do not have your manager installed, please refer to the [{{< param cfy_manager_name >}} setup]({{< relref "/trial_getting_started/set_trial_manager/_index.md" >}}) before moving on.

This section will walk you through the basic concepts of {{< param product_name >}} orchestration by running example scenarios designed to match common required usecases and explain {{< param product_name >}} best practices and proper service design.
It is recommended to start with level one and make your way through the order of the examples; the more advanced examples expect some knowledge gained in earlier levels.
