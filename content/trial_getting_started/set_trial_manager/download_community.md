The {{< param product_name >}} free community version contains a fully functional {{< param product_name >}} engine and supports most of the manager capabilities. This makes it ideal for trying out Cloudify without a premium license. You can read more about the differences between {{< param product_name >}} versions [here](https://cloudify.co/download/community-vs-enterprise/)).

The community version is available as an RPM, OpenStack Image, or Docker container. This page describes the steps necessary to deploy the {{< param product_name >}} trial manager as a Docker container.

You will need a host with [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install) installed to run the {{< param product_name >}} community container image.

## Step 1: Install the {{< param cfy_manager_name >}} as a Docker container

Deploying the community version of the {{< param product_name >}} manager is simple. Using a container provides an easy way to get started with {{< param product_name >}}.

To deploy the container image, simply launch a terminal and create the container:

```bash
{{< param docker_install_command_prefix >}} {{< param docker_image_name >}}
```

This will publish the web interface on port 8080. Verify that the {{< param cfy_manager_name >}} is running by navigating to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). The {{< param product_name >}} login page should be displayed. The default username and password are _admin/admin_.
