The Cloudify free community version contains a fully functional Cloudify engine & most of the manager capabilities (read about the differences between our [Cloudify versions](https://cloudify.co/download/community-vs-enterprise/)).
The community version is available as an rpm, OpenStack Image or as a Docker based container. This page describes the complete setup flow to get an activated Cloudify trial manager as a Docker container.

### Step 1: Install the Cloudify Manager as a Docker container


Deploying Cloudify trial manager as a Docker container is the easiest way to go.
This tutorial assumes that you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install) installed on a local or a remote machine.

Open your terminal and create/start the Docker container (requires password)



```
{{< param docker_install_command_prefix >}} {{< param docker_image_name >}}
```

Verify that your manager is running by browsing to [localhost](http://localhost) when running locally,
or to the hosting machine IP when the Docker server is remote.

The Cloudify login page should be displayed.
