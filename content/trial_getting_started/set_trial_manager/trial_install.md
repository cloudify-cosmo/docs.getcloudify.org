 Cloudify Premium Trial provides a fully functional Premium manager as a Docker container image. This page describes the complete setup flow to get an activated Cloudify trial manager.

### Step 1: Install the Cloudify Manager as a Docker container


Deploying Cloudify trial manager as a Docker container is the easiest way to go.
This tutorial assumes that you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install) installed on a local or a remote machine.

Open your terminal and create/start the Docker container (requires password)
```
{{< param docker_install_command_prefix >}} {{< param docker_image_name >}}
```

Verify that your manager is running by browsing to [localhost](http://localhost) when running locally,
or to the hosting machine IP when the Docker server is remote.

The Cloudify login page should be displayed.

### Step 2: Activate your Trial

A Cloudify license is provided to all Cloudify Premium subscribed customers by Cloudify support.
Cloudify Premium trial customers receive their trial license via email upon trial request.
Request your free 60 days trial at https://cloudify.co/download/#trial.  

Once you receive your license activation key, use it to activate your Cloudify manager. Manager activation (and most other Cloudify actions) can be performed through either Cloudify Management Console (UI) or via Cloudify CLI.
In this tutorial we will demonstrate the usage of the Management Console.

1. Login to the Cloudify Management Console (as done in step 1 above). Login and password are both _admin_.
2. Submit your Cloudify subscription/trial key. Learn more [here](https://docs.cloudify.co/latest/install_maintain/installation/manager-license/#product-activation).
