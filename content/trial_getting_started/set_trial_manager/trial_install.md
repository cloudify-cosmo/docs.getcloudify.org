The {{< param product_name >}} Premium Trial provides a fully functional Premium Manager as a Docker container image. This page describes the complete setup flow to install and activate a {{< param product_name >}} trial Manager.

You will need a host with [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install) installed to run the {{< param product_name >}} Premium Trial container image.

## Step 1: Install the {{< param cfy_manager_name >}} as a Docker container

Deploying the  trial as a Docker container is simple. Using a container provides an easy way to get started with the Premium {{< param cfy_manager_name >}}.

To deploy the container image, simply launch a terminal and create the container:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 cloudifyplatform/premium-cloudify-manager-aio:latest
```

This will publish the web interface on port 8080. Verify that the {{< param cfy_manager_name >}} is running by navigating to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). The {{< param product_name >}} login page should be displayed. The default username and password are _admin/admin_.

## Step 2: Activate your Trial

A {{< param product_name >}} license is provided to all {{< param product_name >}} Premium customers by {{< param product_name >}} support.
{{< param product_name >}} Premium trial customers receive their trial license via email upon trial request. You can request a free 60-day trial [here]({{< param cfy_premium_download_link >}}).

Once you receive your license activation key, use it to activate your {{< param cfy_manager_name >}}. Manager activation (and most other {{< param product_name >}} actions) can be performed through either the {{< param cfy_console_name >}} (UI) or the {{< param cfy_cli_name >}}.

To activate your trial using the UI:

1. Log in to the {{< param cfy_console_name >}} as done in Step 1. The username and password are _admin/admin_.
2. You will be prompted for your subscription key. Provide the subscription key using the dialog.
   * Additional information about the licensing process can be found [here]({{< relref "/install_maintain/installation/manager-license.md#product-activation" >}}).

## Next Steps

Now that you have access to a {{< param cfy_manager_name >}} environment, we recommend performing some additional activities to become comfortable with {{< param company_name >}}. The ideas below are just suggestions to get you started on your journey!

* Try out the [local Hello World example]({{< relref "trial_getting_started/examples/local/local_hello_world_example" >}}) using your new manager. No cloud credentials are required for this simple example.
* Run your first multi-cloud example on AWS, Azure, GCP, and OpenStack using the native {{< param product_name >}} plugins as well as Cloud Formation, Azure ARM, and Ansible plugins by following the  **[example-based tutorials]({{< relref "trial_getting_started/examples/_index.md" >}})**.
* Run your first Kubernetes service on OpenShift, KubeSpray, GKE, EKS, or AKS by following the [Kubernetes reference guide]({{< relref "working_with/official_plugins/orchestration/kubernetes" >}}).
* Manage your installation using the command line utility by reviewing the [local CLI guide]({{< relref "trial_getting_started/set_trial_manager/getting-started-with-cloudify-docker-and-cli" >}}).
