Get the image, request your {{< param product_name >}} trial activation key and run {{< param product_name >}} locally or in any IaaS. A docker setup is expected. You should have access to some IaaS to run your orchestrated workloads on.
* **{{< param product_name >}} Community Version** offers an installer (rpm) or a docker image of the {{< param product_name >}} free version. You may download and try this version for no cost with no time limit. A docker/VM setup is expected. You should have access to some IaaS to run your orchestrated workloads on.
