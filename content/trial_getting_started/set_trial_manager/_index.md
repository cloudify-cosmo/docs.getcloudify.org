Cloudify offers three ways to getting started and on-boarding an orchestration manager:

* **Cloudify as a Service** trial allows for a complete Premium manager service, managed by Cloudify for the duration of the trial period.
 Request your trial account and you can get started with your Cloudify manager within minutes. No hardware is required. You should have access to some IaaS to run your orchestrated workloads on.
* **Cloudify Premium** Trial provides a fully functional Premium manager as a Docker container image. Get the image, request your Cloudify trial activation key and run Cloudify locally or in any IaaS. A docker setup is expected. You should have access to some IaaS to run your orchestrated workloads on.
* **Cloudify Community Version** offers an installer (rpm) or a docker image of the Cloudify free version. You may download and try this version for no cost with no time limit. A docker/VM setup is expected. You should have access to some IaaS to run your orchestrated workloads on.
