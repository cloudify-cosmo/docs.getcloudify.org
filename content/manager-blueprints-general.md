Much like any other blueprint, when bootstrapping a Cloudify Manager, a blueprint is deployed. This blueprint, while not functionally different from regular blueprints, is designed to create the infrastructure for Cloudify's Manager and deploy its applicative requirements.

By utilizing blueprints, users can potentially design their own Cloudify Managers for additional scalability or functionality.

`Manager blueprints` for different IaaS providers are provided by the Cloudify Team. You can find these blueprints in the [cloudify-manager-blueprints repo](https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-manager-blueprints).

Refer to the [bootstrapping page](manager-bootstrapping.html) to bootstrap a Cloudify Manager.
