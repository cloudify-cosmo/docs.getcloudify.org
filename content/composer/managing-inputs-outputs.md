_Inputs_ are parameters that are injected into a blueprint when a deployment is created. They enable you to add data that might not have been available when a blueprint was created. They also enable you to create different "flavors" of a blueprint. 

_Outputs_ provide a method to expose global aspects of a blueprint's deployment. For example, the endpoint of a server, or runtime or static information about a specific resource.

### Adding an Input

1. On the **Inputs & Outputs** tab, enter a name and description for your input.
2. Specify the input value in the **Default** field.   
   You can drag the base of the field to see multiple lines, or click the edit icon next to it to display its contents in a separate window.
3. Select the data type from the dropdown options.
4. Click the Plus (+) icon to add the input to the list.

It is possible to create an input with only a name defined, but it will not be useable until in the deployment until the other fields have been completed.

### Adding an Output

1. On the **Inputs & Outputs** tab, enter a name and description for your output.
2. Specify the output value in the **Default** field.   
   You can drag the base of the field to see multiple lines, or click the edit icon next to it to display its contents in a separate window.
3. Click the Plus (+) icon to add the output to the list.
