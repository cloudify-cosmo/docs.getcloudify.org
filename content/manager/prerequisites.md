A Cloudify Manager has a set of prerequisites, from both infrastructure and OS perspectives.


# Manager Environment

## Host Machine

### Minimal Requirements

A Cloudify Manager must run on a 64-bit machine and requires at the very least 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM and 40GB of free space.

{{% gsNote title="Note" %}}
These are the minimal requirements for a Cloudify Manager to run. You will have to provision larger machines to actually utilize the Manager's capabilites.
We recommend using these specs only for demos and development.

### Recommended Requirements

The recommended requirements can vary based on the following:

* Number of deployments you're going to run.
* Amount of concurrent logs and events you're going to send from your hosts.
* Amount of concurrent metrics you're going to send from your hosts.

As a general recommendation for the average system, a Manager would require at least 8GB of RAM and 4 CPU Cores. Disk space requirements varies according to the amount of logs, events and metrics sent. You can configure log index rotation via the Manager blueprint you're using to bootstrap.


### Network

The Manager listens on the following ports:

 port   | description
--------|--------------
 80     | REST API and UI. This port should be accessible when SSL is not enabled.
 443    | REST API and UI. This port should be accessible when SSL is enabled.
 8101   | REST API. This port is used for internal access and as such should only be accessible from `Agent VMs`.
 22     | During bootstrap, components are installed and configured via SSH. It is used during recovery of the Manager as well.
 5672   | RabbitMQ. This port should be accessible from agent VMs.
 53229  | File server. This port should be accessible from agent VMs.



# OS Distributions

## Management Server

Cloudify can be bootstrapped on either CentOS 7.x or RHEL 7.x.

# What's Next

Next, you should [bootstrap]({{< relref "manager/bootstrapping.md" >}}) a Cloudify Manager on the IaaS provider of your choice.
