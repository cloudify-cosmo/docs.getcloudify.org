Securing access to the manager focuses on the REST service - this is the only access point of clients to the management
server. <br>That is to say, clients communicate with the manager by sending http(s) requests to the REST service, which in
turn processes these requests and communicates with internal management components (e.g. RabbitMQ, Elasticsearch).

![manager architecture]({{< img "guide/security/manager_arch_for_security.png" >}})

When security is enabled, all requests to the manager are authenticated and authorized before reaching their endpoint. <br>
For example, when a Web-UI user attempts to upload a new blueprint, a request is sent to the REST service's
*/blueprints* endpoint. The request will only reach the endpoint if the user is logged in and is authorized to upload
blueprints. <br>Similarly, a user that executes the CLI command `cfy deployments list` triggers a request to execute GET on
*/deployments*, which will only be successful if it includes valid credentials, identifying an authorized
user.
<br>Requests generated by other HTTP clients (e.g. curl) must also include correct credentials.<br>
If credentials are missing, invalid or represent an unauthorized user, the request fails with a "401: Unauthorized User"
error.

Exceptions to this rule are none-secured resources and internal requests:

* The */version* endpoint is not a secured resource, and is therefore open to all users. <br>
* Internal requests (originated by Cloudify) bypass the authentication mechanism by using port 8101. Therefore, This
port must be blocked for external access. See the [Advanced](#advanced) section below for more details.<br>

<br>
### Secured Request Flow
![full request flow]({{< img "guide/security/full_request_flow.png" >}})

The above diagram illustrates the secured request flow:

1. The client sends a request to *server_ip/endpoint* <br>
2. Nginx receives the request. If SSL is enabled, Nginx presents the server's SSL certificate to the client. <br>
   The client can then validate the certificate. If validation fails - the request fails, as the server cannot be trusted. <br>
   If the certificate is validated successfully (or accepted without validation) - request processing
   continues. <br>
3. Is the requested endpoint defined as "secured"? <br>
   Generally, all endpoints are considered secured, which leads to step #4. <br>
   An exception is */version*, which is not a secured resource. In that case, access control checks are not required
   and the request reaches the endpoint directly. <br>
4. Is this an internal request, sent on port 8101? <br>
   If so - the request will proceed directly to the endpoint. <br>
   Otherwise, security checks should take place. <br>
5. Attempt to authenticate the request user - is this user valid? is it known to Cloudify? <br>
   Authentication is performed by the registered authentication providers, as explained below. <br>
   If the user is not authenticated - a "401: Unauthorized User" error is returned. <br>
6. Attempt to authorize the request user - is the user allowed to access the endpoint and execute the requested
   method on it (e.g. GET, POST)? <br>
   Authorization is performed by the registered authorization provider, as explained below. If a provider isn't
   registered, this step will be skipped. <br>
   If the user is not authorized - a "401: Unauthorized User" error is returned. <br>
   Otherwise - congrats! the request can reach its endpoint!

### Security configuration
Security configuration is done in the manager blueprint. The default settings are specified in
[manager-types.yaml](https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-manager-blueprints/blob/3.3/types/manager-types.yaml#L45),
in this path:
{{< gsHighlight  yaml >}}
node_types:
  ...
  cloudify.nodes.MyCloudifyManager:
    ...
    properties:
      ...
      security:
{{< /gsHighlight >}}

The default configuration can be overridden by specific manager blueprint yaml files. Each setting is described in
detail in the following sections.

<br>
#### Setting Security On / Off
The first security setting is:

{{< gsHighlight  yaml  >}}
enabled: { get_input: security_enabled }
{{< /gsHighlight >}}

Security is enabled or disabled according to the input value of `security_enabled`. In order to activate security set
the input value `security_enabled` to `true`. <br>

{{% gsNote %}}
If `security_enabled` is set to `false`, all other security settings will be ignored (including SSL)!
{{% /gsNote %}}

<br>
# SSL
Using SSL for client-server communication enhances security in two aspects: <br>
1. Privacy - All communications between the client the server are encrypted <br>
2. Trust - When a connection is established, the Cloudify manager presents a signed certificate to the
client. The client can use that certificate to validate the authenticity of the manager. <br>

{{% gsInfo title="Client-side certificates are not used"%}} {{% /gsInfo %}}

{{% gsTip title="Using a self-signed certificate" %}}

  A [self-signed certificate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-signed_certificate) can be used. This is a certificate
  that is signed by the manager itself, not by a CA (Certificate Authority).<br>
  In this case, if the client wants to verify the manager's certificate it must hold a copy of that certificate to
  validate against. See [Client SSL configuration](#client-ssl-configuration) for client configuration details.

  The following command can be used to create a self-signed certificate:
  {{< gsHighlight  bash  >}}
    openssl req -x509 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out certificate.pem -days 365 -batch
  {{< /gsHighlight >}}
  For more information see [The openssl req command](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/apps/req.html).
{{% /gsTip %}}

<br>
### SSL configuration
1. Manager Blueprint<br>
  {{< gsHighlight  yaml  >}}
  security:
    ...
    ssl:
      enabled: { get_input: ssl_enabled }
  {{< /gsHighlight >}}

  This means SSL is enabled or disabled according to the input value of `ssl_enabled`.
  In order to enable SSL set the input value `ssl_enabled: true`.
  When enabled, every request to the manager must be sent over https to port 443.<br><br>
2. Required Files<br>
  When running bootstrap, two files should reside in the manager blueprint's directory (on the client machine),
  under *"/resources/ssl"* :<br>
   * server.crt - the signed certificate (this is the public key)<br>
   * server.key - the private key

{{% gsInfo title="Creating a valid certificate"%}}
  The SSL verification process requires the common name in the certificate to match the requested URL. Since all
  requests to the manager use the manager's IP address, it is required that the certificate be created with that IP
  address as its common name.
{{% /gsInfo %}}

<br>
# Manager Access Control

Cloudify's Access Control is comprised of two steps - authentication and authorization. While authentication is
mandatory when accessing a secured resource, authorization is optional. The sections below detail the access control
components and their configuration.

<br>
## Authentication

### Userstore Drivers
While Cloudify does not manage user accounts, some authentication methods may require access to an external userstore -
a repository of users - from which a user object is retrieved. In most cases, the userstore is a directory
(e.g. ActiveDirectory) or a database. *Userstore Drivers* are classes that implement access to different userstore types.
Cloudify assumes there is (at most) one userstore from which all users can be loaded.

#### Userstore driver configuration
Under "userstore_driver" a single userstore is set. Below is the default userstore configuration, set in
manager-types.yaml:
{{< gsHighlight  yaml  >}}
  security:
    ...
    userstore_driver:
      implementation: flask_securest.userstores.simple:SimpleUserstore
      properties:
        userstore:
          users:
            - username: { get_input: admin_username }
              password: { get_input: admin_password }
              groups:
                - cfy_admins
          groups:
            - name: cfy_admins
              roles:
                - administrator
{{< /gsHighlight >}}

The userstore_driver configuration includes two keys:

* implementation - the fully qualified name of the module implementing a userstore driver, followed by ":" and the
class name. <br>In the above configuration, `flask_securest.userstores.simple` is the module, and `SimpleUserstore` is the
class name. <br>
* properties - a dictionary of arguments required to instantiate the implementing class. The arguments will be passed as
kwargs to the class' `__init__` method.

The default configuration uses [Flask-SecuREST's simple userstore]
(https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/flask-securest/blob/0.7/flask_securest/userstores/simple.py).
In this implementation, the userstore is a simple data-structure defined in the manager blueprint and instantiated at
bootstrap. As shown in the configuration above, it contains a single user, and reads its username and password from
input values (`admin_username` and `admin_password` respectively). This implementation is good for demonstrations
purposes. Configuring a "real" userstore driver (e.g. ActiveDirectory) is just as easy, as explained later.

<br>
### Authentication Providers
Authenticating a request can be done in different ways - matching passwords, binding to a directory service or
delegating the login to an external service (oAuth). Each implementation of an authentication methods is called an
*Authentication Provider* (AKA *Authenticator*). When processing a request, Cloudify calls the registered authenticators
(one or more) in the order of definition in the manager-blueprint. If the first authenticator fails to authenticate the
request - the second will be used, and so on, until successful.<br>
If none of the authenticators succeeded, a "401: Unauthorized User" error is returned.

<br>
#### Authentication providers configuration
Under "authentication_providers" is a list of all authenticators in the order they should be executed. At least one
authentication provider must be set. The default configuration set in manager-types.yaml uses two authenticators -
"password" and "token":
{{< gsHighlight  yaml  >}}
  security:
    ...
    authentication_providers:
      - name: password
        implementation: flask_securest.authentication_providers.password:PasswordAuthenticator
        properties:
          password_hash: plaintext
      - name: token
        implementation: flask_securest.authentication_providers.token:TokenAuthenticator
        properties:
          secret_key: my_secret
{{< /gsHighlight >}}

Each Authentication Provider configuration includes these keys:

* name - a unique name describing this authenticator. This name will appear in logs so it should be clear.<br>
* implementation - the fully qualified name of a module implementing an authentication provider, followed by ":" and
the class name.<br>
* properties - a dictionary of arguments required to instantiate the authentication provider class. The arguments will
be passed as kwargs to the class' `__init__` method.

According to the above configuration, Cloudify will use two methods to authenticate requests - matching passwords, or,
if that fails, processing a token. <br>
If none of the authenticators succeed - a "401: Unauthorized User" error is returned. <br>

**Password authentication**
<br>
Cloudify's first authenticator is [Flask-SecuREST's password authenticator]
(https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/flask-securest/blob/0.7/flask_securest/authentication_providers/password.py), which
uses basic HTTP authentication. The request is expected to include an "Authorization" header which contains a base64
encoded [username]:[password] value.
Once decoded, the username is used for retrieving the user object from the userstore, in order to compare the given password
to the stored one.
{{% gsInfo title="Password hash selection" %}}
The default configuration sets `password_hash` to `plaintext`. However, passwords are usually not stored as plaintext.<br>
Set `passowrd_hash` to match the hash scheme used in the selected userstore. <br>
Supported values: 'bcrypt', 'des_crypt', 'pbkdf2_sha256', 'pbkdf2_sha512', 'sha256_crypt' and 'sha512_crypt'.
{{% /gsInfo %}}

**Token authentication**
<br>
Cloudify's second authenticator is [Flask-SecuREST's token authenticator]
(https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/flask-securest/blob/0.7/flask_securest/authentication_providers/token.py).
The request is expected to include a header named "Authentication-Token", in which the username is stored. The token is
signed and timed, meaning a secret key is required to open it, and it will expire some time after creation.
Once opened, the username found is used to load the user object from the userstore.

It is possible to implement other authentication providers, including providers that do not require accessing a
userstore directly (e.g. oAuth). This is explained later in this document.

<br>
### Token Generation
In order to send a token with each request, the client must first obtain a token.
Tokens can be generated by many systems, and they will work as long as a registered authentication provider knows how
to process them.
Cloudify exposes the */tokens* endpoint to help the user obtain a token easily, even from external systems.
To enable this feature a token generator must be set. Then any GET request to */tokens* will call the token generator
and return a token to the user. <br>
Do note that the request to */tokens* is in itself authenticated.

#### Configuring a Token Generator
Under "auth_token_generator" a single generator is set. Below is the default token generator set in manager-types.yaml:
{{< gsHighlight  yaml  >}}
  security:
    ...
    auth_token_generator:
      implementation: flask_securest.authentication_providers.token:TokenAuthenticator
      properties:
        secret_key: my_secret
        expires_in_seconds: 600
{{< /gsHighlight >}}

The auth_token_generator configuration includes two keys:

* implementation - the fully qualified name of the module implementing a token generator, followed by ":" and the
class name. <br>In the above configuration, `flask_securest.authentication_providers.token` is the module, and
`TokenAuthenticator` is the class name.<br>
* properties - a dictionary of arguments required to instantiate the implementing class. The arguments will be passed as
kwargs to the class' `__init__` method. In the configuration shown above two properties are set:
  * `secret_key` - used to sign the token
  * `expires_in_seconds` - limits the lifetime of a token to 10 minutes. A token older than 10 minutes will be expired
and fail the request.
{{% gsNote title="Secret key selection" %}}
The secret key used by the token generator to sign the token must match the secret key used by the token authenticator
to decrypt it.
{{% /gsNote %}}

<br>
## Authorization
After authenticating the request's user, authorization will take place, if an authorization provider is configured.
An authorization provider is used to verify that the user has the permission to execute the requested method (e.g. *GET*)
on the requested endpoint (e.g. */deployments*).

### Default authorization process
By default, Cloudify uses [Flask-SecuREST's Role-Based Authorization Provider]
(https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/flask-securest/blob/0.7/flask_securest/authorization_providers/role_based_authorization_provider.py)
to authorize users. Role-based authorization providers evaluate users permissions based on their assigned roles. <br>
A user can have one or more roles, loaded by the [Simple Role Loader]
(https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/flask-securest/blob/0.7/flask_securest/authorization_providers/role_loaders/simple_role_loader.py);
each role can give the user permissions to access some endpoints methods, and deny others.
<br>
See the configuration sections below for more details on roles and permission assignment.

{{% gsInfo title="Default authorization logic"%}}
In order to be authorized, user access must be explicitly allowed by at least one role **and also not denied by any
role**. <br> If access is allowed by one role but denied by another, the user will not be authorized.
{{% /gsInfo %}}

#### Authorization provider configuration
Under "authorization_provider" a single provider is set. Below is the default authorization configuration, set in
manager-types.yaml:
{{< gsHighlight  yaml  >}}
  security:
    ...
    authorization_provider:
      implementation: flask_securest.authorization_providers.role_based_authorization_provider:RoleBasedAuthorizationProvider
      properties:
        roles_config_file_path: '/opt/manager/roles_config.yaml'
        role_loader:
          implementation: flask_securest.authorization_providers.role_loaders.simple_role_loader:SimpleRoleLoader
{{< /gsHighlight >}}

The authorization_provider configuration includes two keys:

* implementation - the fully qualified name of the module implementing a authorization provider, followed by ":" and the
class name. <br>In the above configuration, `flask_securest.authorization_providers.role_based_authorization_provider`
is the module, and `RoleBasedAuthorizationProvider` is the class name.<br>
* properties - a dictionary of arguments required to instantiate the implementing class. The arguments will be passed as
kwargs to the class' `__init__` method. <br>
In the configuration shown above two properties are set:
  * `roles_config_file_path` - this is the location - on the manager server - of the YAML file that maps roles to permission.
Setting a different path requires modifying the REST creation script accordingly (found at
*"/components/restservice/scripts/create.sh"*, relative to the main manager blueprint file directory).<br>
  * `role_loader` - this is the class that loads the roles of the acting user. By default, the [Simple Role Loader]
(https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/flask-securest/blob/0.7/flask_securest/authorization_providers/role_loaders/simple_role_loader.py)
is used, which loads roles from the simple userstore, inlined in manager-types.yaml.

<br>
#### Role assignment configuration
The [Simple Role Loader]
(https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/flask-securest/blob/0.7/flask_securest/authorization_providers/role_loaders/simple_role_loader.py)
load user roles from the simple userstore defined in *manager-types.yaml*.
Here is a possible configuration:
{{< gsHighlight yaml >}}
  userstore_driver:
    implementation: flask_securest.userstores.simple:SimpleUserstore
    properties:
      userstore:
        users:
          - username: alice
            password: alice_password
            groups:
              - cfy_admins
          - username: bob
            password: bob_password
            groups:
              - cfy_deployers
          - username: clair
            password: clair_password
            roles:
              - viewer
          - username: dave
            password: dave_password
        groups:
          - name: cfy_admins
            roles:
              - administrator
          - name: cfy_deployers
              roles:
                - deployer
{{< /gsHighlight >}}

The above userstore configuration defines four users (*alice*, *bob*, *clair* and *dave*) and 2 groups (*cfy_admins* and
*cfy_deployers*).

* alice - a member of the "cfy_admins" group, which is assigned the "administrator" role. This means alice has
the "administrator" role.
* bob - a memeber of the "cfy_deployers" group, which is assigned the "deployer" role. bob therefore has this role.
* clair - not a member of any group, but is personally assigned the "viewer" role.
* dave - not a member of any group, and has no roles assigned to him directly. He there has no permissions at all.

<br>
#### Role permissions
Linking roles to permissions is done in a YAML file - by default this is */resources/rest/roles_config.yaml*,
relative to the main manager blueprint file directory. <br>
The file contains dictionaries, in which the keys are role names and the values are permissions (also dicts).
Permissions are divided to "allow" or "deny", and specify endpoints and their HTTP methods.
This is a possible (not default) configuration:
{{< gsHighlight  yaml  >}}

################################################################################
# The administrator role can access any endpoint, and call any method
################################################################################
administrator:
  allow:
    '*':
      - '*'
################################################################################
# The deployer role can access any endpoint, and call any method except DELETE
################################################################################
deployer:
  allow:
    '*':
      - '*'
  deny:
    '*':
      - DELETE
#############################################################################
# The viewer role can can access any endpoint, but only call the GET method
# it is also denied access to a specific blueprint
#############################################################################
viewer:
  allow:
    '*':
      - GET
  deny:
    '/api/v2/blueprints/blueprint_2':
      - '*'
{{< /gsHighlight >}}

The above configuration defines permissions of three roles:

* administrator - allowed to access any endpoint (the upper '\*') and execute any method (the inner '\*')
* deployer - allowed to access any endpoint and execute any method, but also denied the `DELETE` method on all endpoints.
<br> This practically means this role can execute any method on any endpoint except call `DELETE`.
* viewer - allowed to execute the `GET` method (and only that method) on all endpoints. Additionally, this role is
denied access to `blueprint_2` entirely! all the methods on this endpoint are denied.

<br>
## Auditing
Security operations, such as authentication success or failure and user details, are audited in dedicated log file on
the management server.<br>
The default configuration is:

{{< gsHighlight  yaml  >}}
audit_log_file: /var/log/cloudify/rest-security-audit.log
audit_log_level: INFO
audit_log_file_size_MB: 100
audit_log_files_backup_count: 20
{{< /gsHighlight >}}

- `audit_log_file` - sets the full path to the auditing file on the manager
- `audit_log_level` - modifying the log level will produce less or more elaborate security auditing; valid values are:
CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO or DEBUG.
- `audit_log_file_size_MB` - limits the log file size. By default, the file is limited to 100 MB. When the file reaches
that size, it will be renamed with the extension ".1" and a new log file will be created (older files will be renamed
with the extension ".2", ".3" and so forth).
- `audit_log_files_backup_count` - sets the maximum number of old log files to keep. By default this value is set to 20.
That means that up to 20 old log files can be created, after which the oldest file will be removed.

<br>
# Clients

Different clients can be used to send requests to the REST service, and all go through an authentication process.
Here we review what each client requires in order to send a secured request.

### CLI - cfy commands
#### credentials
{{% gsNote title="User credentials must be set before bootstrapping" %}}{{% /gsNote %}}

Cfy commands automatically add the "Authorization" header to each request sent to the manager, containing the username
and password of the current user. Setting the user credentials is done once, by exporting these environment variables:

 - export CLOUDIFY_USERNAME=my_username
 - export CLOUDIFY_PASSWORD=my_password

<br>
#### Client SSL configuration
**Connecting to the manager over SSL**<br>
After bootstrap, and if SSL is enabled, requests sent to the manager must use the 'https' protocol and address port 443.
<br>
The bootstrapping client will already be set accordingly; Other clients that attempt to connect to the secured manager
will need to specify port 443 when calling `cfy use`:
{{< gsHighlight  bash  >}}
cfy use -t <manager-ip-address> --port 443
{{< /gsHighlight >}}

**Verifying the manager's certificate**<br>
By default, the CLI attempts to validate the manager's certificate using public CAs (Certificate Authorities).
The following environment variables can alter that behavior:

 * CLOUDIFY_SSL_CERT - if public CAs should not be used (e.g. when working offline or
 validating a self-singed certificate), a client-copy of the server's certificate can be used instead.
To enable this feature, set CLOUDIFY_SSL_CERT to the client's local path to the manager's certificate.
 * CLOUDIFY_SSL_TRUST_ALL - to accept the manager's certificate without validation, set this environment variable to
 True (or any non-empty value)

<br>
### Web UI
Credentials for all requests sent from the Web UI are set at Login. Do note that this client only supports
authentication by username and password. Other authentication methods (e.g. tokens) are currently not supported.

<br>
### Cloudify's REST client
Internally, Cloudify's CLI actually uses Cloudify's [REST client]
(https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-rest-client/tree/3.3-build),
which supports the variety of security configurations discussed in this guide. <br>To use it, create an instance of
[CloudifyClient](https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-rest-client/blob/3.3/cloudify_rest_client/client.py#L231),
initialized with values that match your configuration:

* `host` - The manager's host name or IP address. Default: *'localhost'*
* `port` - The port to send requests to. Default: *80*
* `protocol` - the protocol to send requests on. Default: *'http'*
* `headers` - headers to send with each request. Default: *None*
* `cert` - path to a client copy of the server's certificate (e.g. to validate a self-signed certificate). Default: *None*
* `trust_all` - if set to *True*, SSL certificates will be trusted without validation; if *False* - they will be
validated. Default: *False*


<br>
Here are two usage examples:

* Creating a REST client using credentials, to get a token from a secured manager **without SSL**
{{< gsHighlight  python >}}
from itsdangerous import base64_encode
from cloudify_rest_client import CloudifyClient

headers = {'Authorization': 'Basic ' + base64_encode('MY_USERNAME:MY_PASSWORD')}
rest_client = CloudifyClient(host='1.2.3.4', headers=headers)
token_value = client.tokens.get().value
{{< /gsHighlight>}}

* Creating a REST client using a token, to get the status of a secured manager **with SSL**
{{< gsHighlight  python >}}
from cloudify_rest_client import CloudifyClient

headers = {'Authentication-Token': 'this_is_some_token_value'}
rest_client = CloudifyClient(host='1.2.3.4', port=443, protocol='https', headers=headers)
response = client.manager.get_status()
{{< /gsHighlight>}}




<br>
### External clients
Other REST clients (e.g. cURL) must explicitly add the required header to each request.<br>
For example:

 - Get the server's status, authenticate with username and password:<br>
{{< gsHighlight  bash >}} curl -u 'MY_USERNAME':'MY_PASSWORD' <manager-ip-address>:<port>/api/v2/status{{< /gsHighlight >}}
 - Get a token, authenticate with username and password:<br>
{{< gsHighlight  bash >}} curl -u 'MY_USERNAME':'MY_PASSWORD' <manager-ip-address>:<port>/api/v2/tokens {{< /gsHighlight >}}
 - Get all the blueprints, authenticate with a token:<br>
{{< gsHighlight  bash >}} curl -H 'Authentication-Token:MY_TOKEN' <manager-ip-address>:<port>/api/v2/blueprints {{< /gsHighlight >}}

<br>
# Advanced
## Internal Communication

Currently, communication between Cloudify agents and the manager or within the manager itself does not go through
authentication or authorization. Instead, these requests are sent over port 8101, used by the REST service to identify
them as internal and allow them to proceed directly to the requested endpoint.

Access to this port, however, must be restricted to internal components only. One possible solution is to use a dedicated
subnet for all management components, and limit access to port 8101 through a security group rule (See, for example,
[this rule in the Openstack manager blueprint]
(https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-manager-blueprints/blob/3.3/openstack-manager-blueprint.yaml#L667)).

In future versions, all communications from and to the Cloudify manager will utilize the security mechanisms, including
communication with any of Cloudify's internal components, at which time, the bypass port 8101 will be removed.

<br>
## Customize Security: Use Your Own Implementations
### Implementing custom security components
As shown in previous sections, registering custom python implementations is fairly easy. To replace the default
userstore, token generator, authenticators or authorization provider - simply set the path to the custom class and add
the properties required to instantiate it.
<br>
Implementing security components is just as easy - simply follow the APIs explained below.

#### Userstore driver implementation
A userstore driver is a class that loads user details and returns them as a user object.<br>
A valid userstore implementation is a:

* Python class
* Inherits from [AbstractUserstore](https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/flask-securest/blob/0.7/flask_securest/userstores/abstract_userstore.py)
* Implements `get_user(self, identifier)`, which returns a user object containing a dictionary of user details read from the userstore.
  If a matching user is not found, `get_user` should return None.

<br>
#### Authentication provider implementation
An Authentication Provider is a class that performs authentication. It has access to the userstore instance (if a
userstore was configured) and can therefore use it to get user details that are required to perform authentication (e.g.
check if the user account is disabled). <br>
A valid authentication provider implementation is a:

* Python class
* Inherits from [AbstractAuthenticationProvider]
(https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/flask-securest/blob/0.7/flask_securest/authentication_providers/abstract_authentication_provider.py)
* Implements `authenticate(self, userstore=None)`, which returns a unique user identifier (e.g. username) if
authentication was successful, and raises an exception if it failed. <br>
Exception messages should be informative but not expose confidential user or system details. For example: "Request
authentication header is empty or missing" is OK, while "username jason attempted to use wrong password 123456" reveals
too much information.

<br>
#### Token generator implementation
A token generator is a class that generates tokens and returns them. These tokens should of course be supported by one
of the registered authenticators.<br>
A valid token generator implementation is a:

* Python class
* Implements `generate_auth_token(self)`, which returns a token.

<br>
#### Authorization provider implementation
An authorization provider is a class that performs the authorization logic, after the user authenticity has been verified.
Authorization should evaluate if the acting user is allowed to execute the requested methods (e.g. POST) on the
requested endpoint (e.g. */blueprints*).
A valid authorization provider is a:

* Python class
* Inherits from [AbstractAuthorizationProvider]
(https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/flask-securest/blob/0.7/flask_securest/authorization_providers/abstract_authorization_provider.py)
* Implements `authorize(self)`, which returns true if the user is authorized, or false otherwise.

### Packaging, Configuring and Installing Custom Implementations

In order to use custom security components, each component must be structured as a valid python package and installed
on the REST service environment. Installation is performed via the plugins mechanism, which requires the package
location be added to the `plugins` property of the `rest_service` node in manager-types.yaml:

{{< gsHighlight  yaml  >}}
node_types:
  ...
  manager.nodes.RestService:
    ...
    properties:
      ...
      plugins:
        oauth_authentication_provider:
          # see description below
          source: my-security-plugins/oauth-authentication-provider
          # see description below
          install_args: '--pre'

        mysql_userstore:
          # see description below
          source: https://github.com/my-org/mysql-userstore-driver/archive/master.zip
{{< /gsHighlight >}}

The `plugins` section is a dict that contains all plugins that should be installed. The keys of this dict are arbitrary
names that represents the plugin's function. Use meaningful names to make the configuration more readable. In the
example shown above we use `oauth_authentication_provider` and `mysql_userstore`.

* `source` - can be any of the following:
  * A path to the package directory (a valid python package) relative to the main manager blueprint file
  directory (e.g. `my-security-plugins/oauth-authentication-provider`)
  * A URL to the package archive (e.g. `https://github.com/my-org/mysql-userstore-driver/archive/master.zip`)
* `install_args` - optional additional arguments to the `pip install` command used to install your plugin.


{{% gsNote title="Terminology notice" %}}
When the term *plugin* is used in this section, it should not be confused with operation and workflow plugins.
When we use this term here, we simply mean: custom code that gets installed in the REST service environment. In other
words, plugins here cannot be used as operations and workflows plugins.

### Examples
<br>
#### LDAP Userstore example
[LDAPUserStore]
(https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/flask-securest/blob/0.7/flask_securest/userstores/examples/ldap_userstore.py) is
an example of custom userstore driver that reads users from LDAP. The implementing class inherits from [AbstractUserstore]
(https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/flask-securest/blob/0.7/flask_securest/userstores/abstract_userstore.py)
and implements the `get_user` method as required.

The properties to initialize this class should be specified in the manager blueprint as described earlier in [Userstore driver configuration]
(#userstore-driver-configuration), e.g.
{{< gsHighlight  yaml  >}}
userstore_driver:
  implementation: flask_securest.userstores.examples.ldap_userstore:LDAPUserStore
  properties:
    admin_dn: cn=admin,dc=cloudify,dc=org
    admin_password: password
    directory_url: ldap://localhost:389
    root_dn: dc=cloudify,dc=org
    identifying_attribute: uid
    username_attribute: uid
    user_password_attribute: userPassword
    user_email_attribute: mail
    is_active_attribute: is_active
{{< /gsHighlight >}}
The above properties are specific to this example implementation.

In order to use this custom userstore implementation, it must be installed on the REST service as describe in
[Packaging, Configuring and Installing Custom Implementations]
(#packaging-configuring-and-installing-custom-implementations), e.g.:
{{< gsHighlight  yaml  >}}
node_types:
  ...
  manager.nodes.RestService:
    ...
    properties:
      ...
      plugins:
        ldap_userstore:
          source: ldap-userstore
{{< /gsHighlight >}}
where `ldap-userstore` is the path to the package, relative to the manager blueprint's root directory, e.g.:

{{< gsHighlight  yaml  >}}
my_manager_blueprint:
  my-manager-blueprint.yaml
  ldap-userstore:
    ldap_userstore:
      __init__.py
      simple_ldap_userstore.py
    README.md
    setup.py
{{< /gsHighlight >}}

{{% gsNote title="Handling system dependencies" %}}
The LDAP userstore driver example uses [python-ldap](http://www.python-ldap.org/doc/html/ldap.html#module-ldap).

Ideally, we would like to run this command on plugin installation:
{{< gsHighlight  bash >}}
sudo yum -y install python-ldap
{{< /gsHighlight >}}

Unfortunately, currently there is no convenient way to specify system dependencies as plugin requirements. This is a
known issue and is intended to be solved in future versions.

To work around it, edit the REST creation script of the selected manager blueprint
(*"/components/restservice/scripts/create.sh"* relative to the main manager blueprint file directory). In this script, add the command required to install
[python-ldap](http://www.python-ldap.org/doc/html/ldap.html#module-ldap) just before the REST service installation
command.

Alternatively, modify the relevant manager blueprint to include the installation of the required system dependencies.
