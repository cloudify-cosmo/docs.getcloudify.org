You can bootstrap Cloudify Manager in an environment where there is no internet access. The difference between an online and an offline Manager is quite clear.
The manager has no access to any online resource required by itself, or by any blueprint. In order to setup an offline Manager, an access to the following resources is needed:


- **Cloudify Manager's resource package** - A single package containing all resources required to bootstrap a manager. The resource's url can be found in any of the Manager blueprint's input.yaml files under the `manager_resources_package_url` input.
- **Deployment resources** - Some blueprints require online resources (e.g. openstack-plugin is a resource required by a blueprint deploying on an openstack environment).

In order to resolve this issue, Cloudify Manager starts up a file server on port 53229 which would hold any resource needed by any blueprint.
Cloudify's manager blueprints provides a simple api for uploading resources, and resolving resources paths:

### Uploading resources 
Cloudify provides you with a simple way for uploading resources to the manager through the `upload_resource` section. 
The following example is taken from the [Upload Resources]({{< relref "blueprints/spec-upload-resources.md" >}}) docs page:

{{< gsHighlight  yaml  >}}
upload_resources:
    plugin_resources: 
     - 'http://www.my-plugin.com/path/to/plugin.wgn'
    dsl_resources: 
     - 'source_path': 'http://www.my-plugin.com/path/to/plugin.yaml'
       'destination_path': '/path/to/local/plugin.yaml'
{{< /gsHighlight >}}

The snippet shows how to upload a plugin from http://www.my-plugin.com/path/to/plugin.wgn, and how to upload a plugin.yaml from
http://www.my-plugin.com/path/to/plugin.yaml, and place it on the manager file server with the relative path of /path/to/local/plugin.yaml.

### Resolving inputs 
Cloudify uses the [Import resolver]({{< relref "blueprints/import-resolver.md" >}}) section in the manager blueprint, to create a mapping between URLs.
Below we can see and example of an `import_resolver` section: 

 {{< gsHighlight  yaml  >}}
 import_resolver:
   parameters:
     rules:
     - {'http://www.my-plugin.com/path': 'http://localhost:53229/path'}
 {{< /gsHighlight >}}
The rule specifies a mapping between the source address ('http://www.my-plugin.com/path') as the dictionary key, and the destination address ('http://localhost:53229/path') as the dictionary value.
Once the manager parses the blueprint's `import` section, it first tries the new value supplied. If it fails, it falls back to the source address. 
Below we can see and example of an `import` section: 

{{< gsHighlight  yaml  >}}
imports:
  - http://www.my-plugin.com/path/to/plugin.yaml
{{< /gsHighlight >}}

Upon parsing the blueprint file, the manager tries to resolve each and every resource in the imports list according to the specified rules. In our example, the 
URL http://www.my-plugin.com/path/to/plugin.yaml is first mapped to http://localhost:53229/path/to/local/plugin.yaml, and the manager would try to retrieve 
the resource from the resolved URL. If that fails, the manager would fall back to the original URL.
