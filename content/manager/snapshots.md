## Overview

Snapshot is a `.zip` file that contains all relevant data describing the state of a Cloudify Manager the moment the snapshot is created on this Manager. There are basically four operations associated with snapshots: creating, downloading, uploading and restoring them. For detailed information about snapshots related CLI commands, please visit this [link]({{< relref "cli/reference.html" >}}).

Common use cases for snapshots are:

* Backing up the Manager to be able to restore its state later on, should it become inconsistent or broken for whatever reason.
* Migrating to a newer Cloudify Manager version, by creating a snapshot on the old manager and restoring it on the new one. In this case, if you have any **installed** deployments, you should also execute the [install_new_agents]({{< relref "workflows/built-in-workflows.md#the-install-new-agents-workflow" >}}) workflow on the new manager so that all hosts agents get updated and connected to the new manager's RabbitMQ.

Snapshots are security-sensitive. Broker IP, SSL certificates and credentials are stored in snapshots, as well as keys to agent VMs if an aprropriate flag was used on creating the snapshot.

If you create a snapshot on a Cloudify Manager, delete all blueprints and restore the snapshot on the same Manager, events will be duplicated.

## Snapshot Contents

* **agents.json** - this file contains data necessary for the [install_new_agents]({{< relref "workflows/built-in-workflows.md#the-install-new-agents-workflow" >}}) workflow, mainly necessary to connect to the message broker of the Manager the snapshot has been created on.
* **es_data** - Dump of all ElasticSearch data except for provider context, snapshots and the create snapshot execution that created the snapshot.
* **metadata.json** - Helper file with flags telling the restore snapshot workflow how to proceed with its execution.
* **plugins/** - Folder containing all plugins uploaded to the Manager.
* **snapshot-credentials/** - `.pem` key files for all installed applications VMs.
* **blueprints/** - Extracted blueprints uploaded to the Manager.
* **uploaded-blueprints/** - Blueprints uploaded to the Manager as `.tar.gz` files.

### Creating a snapshot on a Cloudify Manager 3.2.X

To create a snapshot on a `3.2`/`3.2.1` Cloudify Manager, use the [cloudify-3.2.1-snapshots-tool](https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-3.2.1-snapshots-tool). Its purpose is to make creating snapshots on Cloudify Managers 3.2.X possible - this feature has been introduced in the 3.3 version and is not available on earlier versions out of the box. Please see the [README.md](https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-3.2.1-snapshots-tool/blob/master/README.md) file in the tool's repository for more details.
