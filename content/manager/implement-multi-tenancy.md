A tenant is a logical entity that contains all its resources, for example, blueprint, deployment, workflows and so on. Using multi-tenancy is useful when you want to limit access to a specific set of data (the tenant) to a defined set of users.Multi-tenancy is implemented when you install Cloudify Manager.* If you are a **Community user**, a single built-in tenant is created during installation. The tenant is not visible to you and you cannot perform any actions on it such as adding a user or changing a password. There is a single user for the tenant, the `administrator`. When you log into Cloudify Manager, the built-in credentials are used.* If you are a **Premium user**, you can create new tenants and perform a variety of actions on them, such as adding users and user groups, setting passwords, assigning roles, and more. If you integrate LDAP or your AD into Cloudify Manager, you use the users and user groups defined there for access to the manager. You must have Cloudify Manager administrator permissions to perform user-related actions.##Multi-Tenancy for Premium Users##There are two options for using the multi-tenancy function in Cloudify Manager, as a standalone function that is not connected to an existing user managment system (LDAP/AD) or as a function that is integrated with the LDAP/AD user definitions. You must select one option only. If you already have LDAP/AD running in your organization, you probably want to use that, to streamline the process. If you do not use the LDAP/AD option, you must define each user individually.In the following diagram note that there are three tenants in Cloudify Manager. Tenants can be assigned groups of users, individual users, or a combination of both groups and individuals. ![User Distribution on Tenants](/images/manager/multi-tenancy-options.png)###Basic Workflow for Adding Tenants, User Groups and Individual Users###This section describes a basic workflow for adding a tenant, then adding one or more users to it. It is relevant only to Enterprise users.1. You must start with a tenant. When you install Cloudify, a default tenant is also installed. Either use the default tenant or create one or more new tenants.    Use the tenant-related commands that are listed later in this topic to create a new tenant.2. Each tenant has a default Admin user that cannot be deleted. You can add other users to the tenant.    Use the user-related commands that are listed later in this topic to add a new user or user group.  You can add users individually or as part of a group. You can add them manually, or via your organization's LDAP/AD setup.    1. To add a user or user group via LDAP/AD, connect to the LDAP/AD service.  2. To add a single user or user group manually, specify the name of the user or group as part of the command.  3. Specify a password and role for users that you add manually.      Users who are added from LDAP/AD retain their LDAP/AD password. You might still want to assign them a role.####Managing Tenants####Tenants can be added or deleted by an `administrator` user.  When a tenant is created, a default `administrator` is created for it. Additional users and user groups can also be added. Those users can then deploy blueprints on that tenant.When a user runs the `list` command on a tenant, they see all the tenants to which they are assigned - both through individual assignment and through membership of an assigned group.#####Deleting Tenants#####You must ensure that any tenant that you want to delete is empty, meaning that it does not contain any resources.The default tenant that is created during the Cloudify Manager installation/bootstrapping and its `administrator` cannot be deleted.Using the API, an Administrator user can delete a resource on a tenant other than the one which they are currently managing.###Integrating Multi-Tenancy with LDAP/AD###To connect Cloudify Manager with LDAP/AD, you must know the the URL of the service and have sufficient credentials to perform searches and so on. You configure Cloudify with the LDAP configuration during the bootstrap process, in the `manager-input` section. You can also use the API for the configuration, if the Cloudify Manager is clean.####How Cloudify Manager Works with the LDAP/AD Service####When a user logs in to Cloudify Manager, their credentials are passed to the LDAP/AD service for authentication. By default, all users in the LDAP/AD service are authenticated to Cloudify Manager, however only users who have specific permissions for a tenant can access it. When a user logs into Cloudify Manager, the service authenticates the user and returns a list of any groups to which the user belongs. If a Cloudify Manager instance has specified a group name for a tenant that has the same name as a group specified in LDAP/AD, all users in that group can access the tenant (unless an individual user is specifically suspended.) In addition, individual users can be given access to a tenant. The following graphic indicates how Cloudify Manager interacts with an LDAP/AD service. ![User/LDAP Process]: https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/docs.getcloudify.org/tree/adding_mt_docs_init/static/images/manager/multi-tenancy-ldap-relationship.png "User/LDAP Process"####Managing Users in the Multi-Tenancy Environment####There are a number of actions related to user access to tenants that an **`administrator`** user can perform. {{% gsNote title="Note" %}}Although Cloudify is for the most-part case-sensitive, user and group names/DNS are case-insensitive to align with LDAP protocols.{{% /gsNote %}}#####Tenant-Related Commands#####To run these tenant-specific commands, use `cfy tenant`.- `create` enables you to create a tenant- `delete` enables you to delete a tenant- `get` enables you to view information about the tenant, including its users- `list` provides a list of all tenants in this instance of Cloudify Manager#####User-Related Commands#####To run these commands, use `cfy users`.- `add-user` enables you to add an individual user to a tenant- `add-user-group` enables you to add a group of users to a tenant- `remove-user` enables you to remove a specific user from a group- `remove-user-group` enables you to remove a user group from a tenant- `set-password` enables you to set the password for a user (in the case of a non-LDAP/AD setup)- `set-role` enables you to set the role for a user. Possible roles are `administrator`, `user`, and `suspended`. An `administrator` user can perform all the commands listed here. A suspended user cannot access a tenant.####Managing Users in Cloudify Manager outside of LDAP/AD####If you choose not to integrate Cloudify Manager with LDAP/AD, you must add each user individually and set a password for them. You can also create groups and add users to groups to them. The users and user groups can be assigned to one or more tenants.
