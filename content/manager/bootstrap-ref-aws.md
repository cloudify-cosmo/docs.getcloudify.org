# Overview

To bootstrap a manager in AWS, you will need the [Cloudify Manager Blueprints repository](https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-manager-blueprints). This document refers specifically to the aws-ec2-manager-blueprint.yaml and the aws-ec2-manager-blueprint-inputs.yaml files.

## Environment Specific Inputs

- Credentials and identification in order to connect to AWS
    - `aws_access_key_id` No default. Login to your aws [console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) and navigate to (credential report)[https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#credential_report]. See your account administrator if you don't have permission to download the report.
    - `aws_secret_access_key` No default. 
    - `ec2_region_name` Default: us-east-1. This is the region in AWS that you will create resources in when you run the manager blueprint.
