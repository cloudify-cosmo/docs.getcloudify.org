# Inputs

## Required inputs

* `public_ip` The IP used to SSH into the VM.
* `private_ip` The IP that will be used by services in the manager network to connect to its services (RabbitMQ, etc...).
* `ssh_key_filename` The path to the key file used to SSH into the VM.
* `ssh_user` The username to SSH into the VM with.

## Optional inputs

* `agents_user` The default username to be used when connecting into applications' agent VMs (for agent installtion).
* `resources_prefix` Resource prefix to be attached to cloud resources' names.


# Topology

The topology consists merely of a single host, on which the Cloudify manager will be installed.


# Nodes

The "simple manager" blueprint contains the following nodes:

  - *manager_host* - The machine on which the Cloudify manager will be installed.
  - *manager* - The node which represents the manager. You may find more information about this node in the [Types Reference](#reference-types.html#cloudifymanager-type) section as well as in the [Manager Blueprints Authoring guide](getting-started-write-blueprint.html).

{{% gsNote %}}
When bootstrapping a manager on a [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) based VM using the (default) VirtualBox provider, make sure to increase the memory of the VM to at least 2GB.

It should look like this:
{{< gsHighlight  ruby >}}
Vagrant.configure('2') do |config|
  config.vm.provider :virtualbox do |vb|
    vb.customize ['modifyvm', :id, '--memory', '2048']
  end
end
