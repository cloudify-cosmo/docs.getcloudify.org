Cloudify provides a method for provisioning applications using Cloudify blueprints and allows utilizing workflows and plugins. While this is useful, managing the application post-deployment requires a lot more and this is where the Cloudify Manager comes in to play.

Cloudify's Manager allows users to manager multiple applications deployed via multiple blueprints, executing different workflows on those applications independently and viewing application related information like the application's topology, logs and metrics using a web interface.
