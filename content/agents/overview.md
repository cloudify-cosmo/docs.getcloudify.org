Cloudify agents are entities that are installed on hosts that are part of your blueprint, and are used to communicate with Cloudify Manager.

The agents provide a way to:

* Execute operations
* Execute workflows on deployments


## Agent Packages

Cloudify includes a set of agent packages with support for:

* CentOS 6.4 / 6.5 (Python 2.6.x) and CentOS 7.x (Python 2.7.x).
* RHEL 7.x (Python 2.7.x).
* Ubuntu 12.04 / 14.04 (Python 2.7.x).
* Windows 2008, and later (Python 2.7.x).


## Communication with the manager

The agents communicate with the manager over two channels:
1. HTTPS on port 53333 - REST API
2. AMQP over TLS on port 5671 - RabbitMQ

By default, the agent connects to the manager's private IP [as specified
during manager installation]({{< relref "installation/installing-manager.md" >}}).
It is possible to define other IPs/hostnames during the manager installation in the agent section in the config.yaml file.
