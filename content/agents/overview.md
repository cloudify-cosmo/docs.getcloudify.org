Cloudify agents are entities that are installed on hosts that are part of your blueprint, and are used to communicate with Cloudify Manager.

The agents provide a way to:

* Execute operations
* Execute workflows on deployments


## Agent Packages

Cloudify includes a set of agent packages with support for:

* CentOS 6.4 / 6.5 (Python 2.6.x) and CentOS 7.x (Python 2.7.x).
* RHEL 7.x (Python 2.7.x).
* Ubuntu 12.04 / 14.04 (Python 2.7.x).
* Windows 2008, and later (Python 2.7.x).


## Installation

### Installation script

The same installation script is used in all of the installation methods.
This is either a `bash` script on Linux or a `powershell` script on Windows.
The script is agent-specific, and a separate script is rendered from a
template for each agent during the `install` workflow.
The script downloads the agent package from the manager (over port 53333),
extracts it on the agent host, creates a daemon and starts it.


### Installation methods

There are several methods by which the installation script is distributed
to the agent host and executed.

* `remote` - The installation script is pushed to the agent host, and
executed remotely using SSH on Linux hosts and WinRM on Windows hosts.
This is the default and simplest way for systems that allow SSH/WinRM
access. A pre-requisite for remote installation is:
    * For Linux, an SSH server must be running on the agent host, and
    the SSH port (22 by default) must be open for incoming connections.
    * For Windows, WinRM must be enabled, and the WinRM port (5985 by
    default) must be open for incoming connections. To enable WinRM,
    the following commands must be executed on the host (e.g. in `userdata`).

    {{< gsHighlight  bash  >}}
    winrm quickconfig -q
    winrm set winrm/config              @{MaxTimeoutms="1800000"}
    winrm set winrm/config/winrs        @{MaxMemoryPerShellMB="300";MaxShellsPerUser="2147483647"}
    winrm set winrm/config/service      @{AllowUnencrypted="true";MaxConcurrentOperationsPerUser="4294967295"}
    winrm set winrm/config/service/auth @{Basic="true"}
    netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="WinRM 5985" protocol=TCP dir=in localport=5985 action=allow
    {{< /gsHighlight >}}
{{% gsNote title="Note" %}}

1.  The commands above are provided in a syntax that is suitable for
invocation from a command-prompt window. If using userdata (or an
equivalent feature), it might be necessary to adjust the commands to
accommodate its requirements (for example: if these commands are to be
run within a batch file, each line must be prefixed with `call`).
2.  The commands are very permisive and must adjusted according to
your requirements. These settings provide unencrypted WinRM access to
the machine. From MSDN: `AllowUnencrypted` - Enables the client computer
to request unencrypted traffic.

* `init_script` - For systems that don't have SSH/WinRM access, userdata
(e.g. cloud-init) may be used. In this method, an install script is
rendered, and a temporary link pointing to it is created. This link is
then embedded in a separate `download script`, which is injected into
the agent host's userdata. When the host is booted for the first time,
the download script is executed. It downloads the installation script
from the temporary link and executes it.
To use the `init_script` method, the IaaS provider and Cloudify plugin
need to support userdata. Currently, the Openstack
and AWS plugins support this installation method.

* `plugin` - For systems that have neither SSH/WinRM access, nor
the ability to inject a script into userdata, the `plugin` installation
method allows implementing a custom way to download and execute the
installation script. In this method, a temporary download link for the
installation script is created and made available to the plugin using
the `ctx`. It is upt to the plugin developer then to implement a custom
method for downloading and executing the installation script on the
agent's host.

* `provided` - For systems that require the agent to be embedded in the
image, users can use the `provided` method. In this mode, it is up to
the user to make sure the agent is already installed on the image.
During the `install` workflow, a configuration script will be rendered
and a temporary link to it will created and made available
via Cloudify's logs (reading the logs is the only way to retrieve
the temporary link). This script is
similar to the installation script, except that it doesn't download or
install the agent package, but only configures and starts the agent
daemon. This script needs to be downloaded and executed manually for
every agent.

* `none` - In some cases, the user cannot or prefers not to install an agent
on Cloudify-managed VMs. This might be due to a security restriction,
or because a VM is a pre-configured closed appliance that the user cannot
access or modify.
This has the following implications:
    * It will not be possible to use plugins that assume execution on the agent's
VM, meaning plugins that are configured with `executor=host_agent`.
This includes Docker, Chef and Puppet plugins, among others. To work around this you must run bash or Python scripts using the [Fabric plugin]({{< relref "plugins/fabric.md" >}}) (for example, invoke the Puppet client from a script instead of using the Puppet plugin).
    * It will not be possible to install a [Diamond monitoring agent](http://diamond.readthedocs.org/) using the [Diamond plugin]({{< relref "plugins/diamond.md" >}}) because this plugin requires an agent to run. However, you can install your own monitoring agent using a cloud-init / the Fabric plugin.


### Specifying the Installation Method
To specify the installation method that will be used, set the `install_method` property in the compute node `agent_config` property. For example:

```yaml
node_templates:
  my_vm:
    type: cloudify.nodes.Compute
    properties:
      agent_config:
        # one of none, remote, init_script, provided, plugin
        install_method: remote
```


## Configuration Locations

Agent configuration consists of several locations that all adhere to the same schema. The schema is based on the [`cloudify.datatypes.AgentConfig` datatype](#configuration-properties), which is defined in the standard `types.yaml`.

The order in which each property is resolved is as follows:

### 1. Operation Inputs
If a property has been provided as part of the operation inputs in `agent_config` (or the depcrecated `cloudify_agent`), it is used. For example:

{{< gsHighlight  yaml  >}}
node_templates:
  my_vm:
    type: cloudify.nodes.Compute
    interfaces:
      cloudify.interfaces.cloudify_agent:
        create:
          inputs:
            agent_config:
              # configuration goes here
              user: centos
              ...
{{< /gsHighlight >}}


### 2. Node Instance Runtime Property
If the agent to be installed is a host agent (and not a central deployment agent), and the property is provided as part of the `cloudify_agent` node instance runtime property, it is used.


### 3. Node Property
If the agent to be installed is a host agent (and not a central deployment agent), and the property has been provided as part of the `agent_config` (or the deprecated `cloudify_agent`) node property, it is used. For example:

{{< gsHighlight  yaml  >}}
node_templates:
  my_vm:
    type: cloudify.nodes.Compute
    properties:
      agent_config:
        # configuration goes here
        user: centos
        ...
{{< /gsHighlight >}}


### 4. Bootstrap Context
If the property has been provided during bootstrap as part of the `cloudify_agent` in the Manager blueprint, it is used. For example, consider the following excerpt
from a Manager blueprint:

{{< gsHighlight  yaml  >}}
...
node_templates:
  manager_configuration:
    type: cloudify.nodes.MyCloudifyManager
    properties:
      ...
      cloudify:
        ...
        cloudify_agent:
          # configuration goes here
          user: centos
          ...
...
{{< /gsHighlight >}}

Yu can use this section to specify a global agent configuration that will apply to all installed agents. This is the only way to set deployment agents configuration.

# Configuration Properties

Name                 | Type        | Description
------------         | ----------- | -----------
`user`               | string      | For host agents, the agent will be installed for this user.
`key`                | string      | For host agents that are installed via SSH, this is the path to the private key that will be used to connect to the host. <br> In most cases, this value is derived automatically during bootstrap.
`password`           | string      | For host agents that are installed via SSH (on Linux) and WinRM (on Windows), this property can be used to connect to the host. <br> For Linux hosts, this property is optional if the `key` property is correctly configured (either explicitly or implicitly during bootstrap). <br> For Windows hosts that are installed via WinRM, this property is also optional and depends on whether the `password` runtime property has been set by the relevant IaaS plugin, prior to agent installation.
`port`               | integer     | For host agents that are installed via SSH (on Linux) and WinRM (on Windows), this is the port used to connect to the host. <br> The default values are `22` for Linux hosts and `5985` for Windows hosts.
`min_workers`        | integer     | Minimum number of agent workers. By default, the value is  `0`. See [Auto Scaling]({{< field "autoscale_link" >}}) for further details. <br> Note: For Windows-based agents, this property is ignored and `min_workers` is set to the value of `max_workers`.
`max_workers`        | integer     | Maximum number of agent workers. By default, the value is  `5`. See [Auto Scaling]({{< field "autoscale_link" >}}) for further details.
`disable_requiretty` | boolean     | For Linux based agents, disables the `requiretty` setting in the sudoers file. By default, this value is `true`.
`process_management` | dictionary  | Process management specific configuration. See [Process Management](#process-management).
`env`                | dictionary  | Optional environment variables with which the agent will be started.
`extra`              | dictionary  | Optional additional low-level configuration details.

## Extra configuration properties (that go under the `extra` property)

Name                | Type        | Description
-------------       | ----        | -----------
`distro`            | string      | Linux operation system distribution. See [Agent Package Resolution](#agent-package-resolution).
`distro_codename`   | string      | Linux operation system distribution release. See [Agent Package Resolution](#agent-package-resolution).
`package_url`       | string      | Specify an explicit URL from which to download the agent package.
`uri`               | string      | For Windows-based agents, WinRM URI. By default, the value is `wsman`.
`protocol`          | string      | For Windows-based agents, WinRM protocol. By default, the value is `http`.
`fabric_env`        | dictionary  | For Linux-based agents, configure fabric that is used to SSH into the remote host.


## Process Management

Additional configuration can be supplied to the service manager that will be used to manage the installed agent by using the `process_management` property.

### Linux init.d Process Management

Name                    | Type    | Description
-------------           | ----    | -----------
`start_on_boot`         | boolean | Specifies whether the agent service should be restarted after a system reboot. By default, the value is `true`.


### Windows NSSM Process Management

Name                    | Type    | Description
-------------           | ----    | -----------
`startup_policy`        | string  | Specifies the start type for the service. By default, the value is `auto`. See [*sc config*]({{< field "sc_link" >}}#E0UC0AA).
`failure_reset_timeout` | integer | `reset` value passed to `sc failure` during service configuration. By default, the value is 60. See [*sc failure*]({{< field "sc_link" >}}#E02B0AA).
`failure_restart_delay` | integer | Specifies delay time (in milliseconds) for the restart action. By default, the value is 5000. See [*sc failure*]({{< field "sc_link" >}}#E02B0AA)


## Linux Agent Package Resolution

In most cases, the agent package that will be used to install the agent is automatically resolved and does not require manual configuration. However, a mechanism exists that enables the implicit resolution to be overwritten. Following is a short description of the implicit resolution mechanism and details about how to override the implicit resolution with hard-coded values.

The install process attempts to identify the distribution and its release, and to deploy the correct type of agent for them.
The identification process is based on Python's `platform.dist()`. We reference the first attribute of the tuple returned by this call as `distro`, and the third attribute as `distro_codename`. For example, making this call on Ubuntu trusty returns a tuple in which the `distro` attribute is `Ubuntu` and the `distro_codename` attribute is `trusty`.
After making the call, the package name that is downloaded from the management file server is `{distro}-{distro_codename}-agent.tar.gz`, where `distro` and `distro_codename` are converted to lowercase characters. In the case of Ubuntu trusty, the package name is `ubuntu-trusty-agent.tar.gz`.

If `distro`, `distro_codename`, or `package_url` are provided explicitly in the [extra agent configuration](#extra-configuration-properties-that-go-under-the-extra-property), they will be used instead of the implicit mechanism.
