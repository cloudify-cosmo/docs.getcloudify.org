# Where Are My Log Files?

Cloudify log files commonly reside inside the docker container running the management services.
In order to access the container to view log files, first ssh into the host machine. From it, access the container
using this command: `sudo docker exec -it cfy bash`

# Security Audit Log

When starting Cloudify manager in a secured mode, requests sent to the REST server go through authentication. <br>
The security audit log file documents successful and failed REST calls, their origin, method of authentication and
, if the authentication failed, the reason for the failure.

As mentioned above, the log file resides on the docker container running on the manager host machine. By default, it is
located in `/var/log/cloudify/rest-security-audit.log`. The default logging level is `INFO`. The maximum file size is
100 MB, after which the filename will be appended an index number (e.g. rest-security-audit.log.1) and a new log file
will be created. Up to 20 old log files can be stored. All these settings can be configured in the manager
blueprint, as explained [here](images/guide/guide-security.html#logging).


# REST Service Logs

The REST service runs using the Flask web framework on top of the Gunicorn HTTP server, which is run as an Upstart service. Each of these layers has its own logs.


## Flask logs

The Flask logger, using which the REST service writes custom logs, additionally records each request-response pair with their relevant parameters and information.

The main log file sits at `/var/log/cloudify/cloudify-rest-service.log`.

This file will grow up to a maximum size of 100MB, after which older logs will be renamed to `cloudify-rest-service.log.1`, `cloudify-rest-service.log.2`, and so on, with new logs being written to the main log file.
After a maximum of 20 files, older files will get deleted when new logs arrive.

The IDs which appear in the *Request* and *Response* lines are meant to help understand which response belongs to which request. However, these IDs might not (and will not) be unique over time - yet it's always certain that a response with a specific ID is linked to the request with that same ID which came right before it.

## Gunicorn logs

There are two log files Gunicorn writes to: an access log and a general log.

The access log simply logs a concise entry for each request made to the web server.

This log file sits at `/var/log/cloudify/gunicorn-access.log`


{{% gsCloak "Example output" %}}
{{< gsHighlight  yaml  >}}
62.90.11.161 - - [27/Nov/2014:10:35:23] "PUT /deployments/dep4 HTTP/1.0" 201 2410 "-" "python-requests/2.2.1 CPython/2.7.6 Linux/3.13.0-39-generic"
10.67.79.2 - - [27/Nov/2014:10:35:24] "GET /nodes?deployment_id=dep4 HTTP/1.0" 200 44018 "-" "python-requests/2.4.3 CPython/2.7.3 Linux/3.2.0-32-virtual"
10.67.79.2 - - [27/Nov/2014:10:35:24] "GET /node-instances?deployment_id=dep4 HTTP/1.0" 200 2236 "-" "python-requests/2.4.3 CPython/2.7.3 Linux/3.2.0-32-virtual"
{{< /gsHighlight >}}
{{% /gsCloak %}}


The general log mostly has information on Gunicorn workers. It is usually only interesting when there was a problem in starting up the REST service and Flask.

This log file sits at `/var/log/cloudify/gunicorn.log`


{{% gsCloak "Example output" %}}
{{< gsHighlight  yaml  >}}
2014-11-27 10:33:40 [20264] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 18.0

## Upstart logs

The upstart log with regards to the REST service sits at `â€‹/var/log/upstart/manager.log`.

It shouldn't have any interesting information, unless there was a problem in starting up the service and Gunicorn.
