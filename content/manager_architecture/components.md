This section is to provide information about how the Cloudify architecture supports currently-implemented flows. Operational knowledge is assumed.


Cloudify Manager primarily comprises the following open-source components. Their relationship in the Cloudify Manager architecture is illustrated in the following diagram.

* [Nginx](#nginx)
* [Gunicorn](#gunicorn-and-flask)
* [Flask](#gunicorn-and-flask)
* [PostgreSQL](#postgresql)
* [Logstash](#logstash)
* [RabbitMQ](#rabbitmq)
* [Riemann](#riemann)
* [Celery](#celery)
* [InfluxDB](#influxdb-and-grafana)
* [Grafana](#influxdb-and-grafana)

## Ports and Entry Points

Rather than specifying the ports in each component's overview, ports are specified here so that you can easily review network requirements.

### External Ports

By default, there are two external networks from which the Cloudify management environment is accessed:

* The network on which the CLI resides, which is potentially a user's `management network`.
* The network on which the application resides, which is potentially a user's application network.

Therefore, Cloudify requires only two entry points to its management environment:

* Ports 80 / 443 for user rest-service/UI access via Nginx

* Port 5672 for application access via RabbitMQ

* Port 53333 is exposed for FileServer access, with a `/resources` prefix, for example, `https://{manager_ip}:53333/resources/blueprints/default_tenant/blueprint_id/filename.yaml`.
* Port 22 is exposed for SSH access, to enable the CLI to bootstrap the Cloudify management environment.  
  While this is currently a requirement in the default bootstrap method in the CLI, using `userdata/cloudinit` to bootstrap will make this requirement obsolete. However it is important to understand that `cfy ssh` will not work in this case.
* The only _external_ access to the management environment is not done through one of these entry points. It is achieved by the Cloudify agent on the host accessing Nginx directly, rather than through RabbitMQ to update the application's model (for example, when runtime-properties are set). 

### Internal Ports

The following internal ports are exposed:

* The REST service is accessed via port 53333
* The UI is accessed via port 9100
* PostgreSQL exposes port 9200 for HTTP API access
* RabbitMQ exposes port 5672
* InfluxDB exposes port 8086 for HTTP API access
* Logstash exposes a dummy port 9999 to verify the communication is live

# Nginx

[Nginx](http://nginx.com/) is a high-performing Web server. In Cloudify Manager, it serves two purposes:

* A proxy for the Cloudify REST service and Web interface
* A file server to host Cloudify-specific resources, agent packages and blueprint resources.

## File Server

The file server served by Nginx, while tied to Nginx by default, is not logically bound to it. Although currently it is accessed directly in several occurences (via disk rather than via network), we will be working towards having it completely decoupled from the management environment so that it can be deployed anywhere.

# Gunicorn and Flask

[Gunicorn](http://gunicorn.org/) is a Web server gateway interface HTTP server. [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a Web framework.

Together, Gunicorn and Flask provide the Cloudify REST service. The REST service is written using Flask, and Gunicorn is the server. Nginx, is the proxy to that server.
The Cloudify's REST service is the integrator of all parts of the the Cloudify environment.

# PostgreSQL

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is an object-relational database that can handle workloads ranging from small single-machine applications to large Internet-facing applications.

In Cloudify Manager, PostgreSQL serves two purposes:

* Provides the main dateabase that stores the application's model (i.e. blueprints, deployments, runtime properties)
* Provides indexing, and logs' and events' storage

## Indices

PostgreSQL is initially provisioned with two indices:

* `cloudify_storage` - Stores the data model (blueprints, deployments, runtime properties, etc..)
* `cloudify_events` - Stores logs and events 

The indices and their mappings are generated at build time. To keep the indices and their data persistent, they are mapped to a data container.

# Logstash

[Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash) is a data handler. It can push/pull messages using several inputs, and apply filters and output to different outputs.

Logstash is used by Cloudify to pull log and event messages from RabbitMQ and index them in Elasticsearch.

# RabbitMQ

[RabbitMQ](http://www.rabbitmq.com/) is a queue-based messaging platform.

RabbitMQ is used by Cloudify as a message queue for different purposes:

* Queueing deployment tasks
* Queueing logs and events
* Queueing metrics

Currently not all requests between Cloudify's Manager and the hosts it manages go through RabbitMQ. We aim to make it so.

# Riemann

[Riemann](http://riemann.io/) is an event stream processor used primarily for monitoring.

Riemann is used within Cloudify as a policy-based decision maker. For more information on policies, see the [policies]({{< relref "manager_policies/overview.md" >}}) section.

{{% gsNote title="Note" %}}
The use of Riemann as a policy engine in Cloudify is an experimental feature and, as such, is not guaranteed to be forward-compatible. It is also somewhat incomplete.

# Celery

[Celery](http://www.celeryproject.org/) is a distributed task queue.

the Cloudify management worker, the deployment-specific agents and the host agents are based on Celery.

## Deployment-Specific Agents

Both the `deployment workflow agent` and the `deployment agent` that appear in the diagram are deployment specific. Two of these agents are created for every deployment.

* The `deployment workflow agent` executes deployment-specific workflows.
* The `deployment agent` executes API calls to IaaS providers to create deployment resources, or submits tasks to RabbitMQ for execution by the host agents.

Note that all agents (management, deployment-specific, and host) are the same physical entity (a virtualenv with Python modules - Cloudify plugins installed in them).

## Management Worker (or Agent)

An entity removed from the diagram is a management agent containing a Cloudify plugin able to spawn the aforementioned deployment-specific agents. This agent is run during the bootstrap process.

# InfluxDB and Grafana

[InfluxDB](http://influxdb.com/) is a time-series database. [Grafana](http://grafana.org/) is a dashboard for InfluxDB.

* A proprietary metrics consumer is used to pull metrics from RabbitMQ and submit them to InfluxDB.
* InfluxDB is used by Cloudify to store metrics that are primarily submitted by the application's hosts.
* Grafana is embedded within the Cloudify Web interface to graph the metrics that are stored in InfluxDB.
