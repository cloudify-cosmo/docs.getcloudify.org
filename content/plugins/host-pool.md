# Description

The plugin is an infrastrcture provisioning plugin that is used in conjunction with Cloudify's [Host-Pool Service](https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-host-pool-service) to use hosts from a pool of existing hosts.
When the plugin is requested to provision a host, it will make a request to the Host-Pool-Service, which will in turn look for available hosts inside the pool, and assign the first one to that request.
The same flow is executed when the plugin is requested to release that host.
The pool of available hosts will be determined at the time of the Host-Pool-Service installation, as explained below.

# Host-Pool Service

The Host-Pool Service is a web service designed for managing a large pool of hosts to be used by cloudify deployments.
It allows for the use of multiple existing hosts to be allocated for a deployment. Supports defining hosts by:

  * name
  * ip address
  * ip ranges (for easily specifying a large amount of identical hosts).

The Host-Pool-Plugin will make calls to this service each time a new host
needs to be provisioned/terminated.

To make the installation of this service easy, we have made it available as a regular cloudify node type.

## cloudify.nodes.HostPoolService

**Derived From:** [cloudify.nodes.SoftwareComponent](reference-types.html)

**Properties:**

  * `pool` relative path to a pool configuration file. This is where you define all the hosts participating in the pool.
  * `working_directory` the directory to run the service from inside the host. Defaults to `/tmp/cloudify-host-pool-service`
  * `port` the port to run the service on. Defaults to `8080`
  * `source` the source code of the service. Defaults to `https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-host-pool-service/archive/master.zip`

**Mapped Operations:**

  * `cloudify.interfaces.lifecycle.create` creates the necessary directories and installs dependencies.
  * `cloudify.interfaces.lifecycle.configure` creates the service configuration file based on information in the properties.
  * `cloudify.interfaces.lifecycle.start` starts the service.
  * `cloudify.interfaces.lifecycle.stop` stops the service.
  * `cloudify.interfaces.lifecycle.delete` deletes the service working directory.

**Attributes:**

  * `endpoint` the url of the service. This URL is determined by combining the `port` property of the type, with the ip of the host the service is contained within.
  The ip is either the `ip` attribute of the containing host node, or, in case it is absent, the `ip` property of the node.
  You can effectively think of this endpoint like the cloud endpoints you are probably used to.

{{% gsInfo title="Information" %}}
Complete definition of this type can be found [Here](https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-host-pool-service/blob/master/host-pool-service.yaml)

You must have a running Host-Pool Service before you can start using the Plugin

# Examples


{{% gsCloak "Local Installation" %}}
This example will show how to install the service on you local machine using a cloudify local blueprint. it also presents an example configuration file.
The following is an excerpt from the complete blueprint located [Here](https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-host-pool-service/blob/master/examples/local-blueprint)

{{< gsHighlight  yaml  >}}
node_templates:
  host:
    type: cloudify.nodes.Compute
    properties:
      install_agent: false
      ip: localhost
  host_pool_service:

{{% gsCloak "Pool Configuration File" %}}
This [example](https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-host-pool-service/blob/master/examples/local-blueprint/pool.yaml) shows how to create a pool configuration file to be supplied to the Host-Pool Service.

# Plugin Requirements

* Python Versions:
    * 2.7.x
    * 2.6.x

# Types

## cloudify.hostpool.nodes.Host

**Derived From:** [cloudify.nodes.Compute](reference-types.html)

**Mapped Operations:**

  * `cloudify.interfaces.lifecycle.create` acquires a host from the Host Pool service.
    * **Inputs:**
      * `service_url` the url of the running Host Pool Service.
  * `cloudify.interfaces.lifecycle.delete` releases a host from the Host Pool service.
    * **Inputs:**
      * `service_url` the url of the running Host Pool Service.

**Attributes:**

  * `ip` the private ip of the host.
  * `user` the username of the host.
  * `port` the authentication port of this host.
  * `public_address` the public address of the host.
  * `password` the password of the host.
  * `key` the content of the keyfile used to login to the host.

{{% gsNote title="Note" %}}
All of the above attributes are actually the host configuration as passed to
 the Host-Pool Service in the pool configuration file.
{{% /gsNote %}}

  * `host_id` the id assigned to this host by the Host-Pool Service.

## cloudify.hostpool.nodes.WindowsHost

**Derived From:** cloudify.hostpool.nodes.Host

This type has the same properties and operations-mapping as the type above (as it derives from it), yet it overrides some of the agent and plugin installations operations-mapping derived from the [built-in cloudify.nodes.Compute type](reference-types.html). Use this type when working with a Windows server.
