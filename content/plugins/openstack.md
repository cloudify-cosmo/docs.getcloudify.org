The OpenStack plugin enables you to use an OpenStack-based cloud infrastructure for deploying services and applications.
For more information about OpenStack, see [https://www.openstack.org/](https://www.openstack.org/).


# Plugin Requirements

* Python versions:
  * 2.7.x
* If the plugin is installed from source, the following system dependencies are required:
  * `gcc`
  * `gcc-c++`
  * `python-devel`

# Compatibility

* **Mitaka** official support\*
* **Liberty** official support\*
* **Kilo** official support
* **Juno**, **Icehouse** previously supported, not currently tested.


The OpenStack plugin uses various OpenStack client packages. The versions used in the OpenStack plugin are as follows:

  * [Nova client](https://github.com/openstack/python-novaclient) - 2.26.0
  * [Neutron client](https://github.com/openstack/python-neutronclient) - 2.6.0
  * [Cinder client](https://github.com/openstack/python-cinderclient) - 1.2.2
  * [Keystone client](https://github.com/openstack/python-keystoneclient) - 1.6.0

# OpenStack Configuration

The OpenStack plugin requires credentials and endpoint setup information in order to authenticate and interact with OpenStack.
### Providing Credentials as Secrets

 It is recommended that you store your credentials as [secrets]({{< relref "manager/using-secrets.md" >}}). You can do this using the [CLI]({{< relref "cli/secrets.md" >}}).
 Secrets can then be accessed inside your blueprints, as follows:

 {{< gsHighlight  yaml  >}}
 external_network:
    type: cloudify.openstack.nodes.Network
    properties:
      openstack_config:  
        username: { get_secret: keystone_username }
        password: { get_secret: keystone_password }
        tenant_name: { get_secret: keystone_tenant_name }
        auth_url: { get_secret: keystone_url }
        region: { get_secret: region }
 {{< /gsHighlight >}}   

### Providing Credentials as Environment Variables that are not Stored as Secrets

The OpenStack client suite (Nova, Neutron and so on) will always look for your OpenStack credentials and endpoint setup information in the following order. These values take precedence because this is the default behavior of the client library. It is not recommended that these are included.

  1. Environment variables for each of the configuration parameters.
  2. JSON file at `/etc/cloudify/openstack_config.json` or at a path specified by the value of an environment variable named `OPENSTACK_CONFIG_PATH`

On the other hand, the plugin gathers credentials from the following sources, in the following order. This is the supported approach.

{{% gsWarning title="Caution" %}}
Each source could partially or completely override values gathered from previous ones.
{{% /gsWarning %}}

  1. Values specified in the `openstack_config` property for the node whose operation is currently getting executed (in the case of relationship operations, the `openstack_config` property of either the *source* or *target* nodes will be used if available, with the *source*'s one taking precedence).
  2. Values specified in the `openstack_config` runtime property for the node instance whose operation is currently being executed (in the case of relationship operations, the `openstack_config` property of either the *source* or *target* node instances will be used if available, with the *source*'s one taking precedence).
  3. Values specified in the `openstack_config` operation input.

The `openstack_config` property can contain these key-value pairs.

* `username` Username for authentication with the OpenStack Keystone service.
* `password` Password for authentication with the OpenStack Keystone service.
* `tenant_name` Name of the tenant to be used.
* `auth_url` URL of the OpenStack Keystone service.
* `region` OpenStack region to be used. This can be optional when there is only a single region.
* `nova_url` (**Deprecated** - instead, use `custom_configuration` to pass `bypass_url` directly to the Nova client.) Explicit URL for the OpenStack Nova service. This can be used to override the URL for the Nova service that is listed in the Keystone service.
* `neutron_url` (**Deprecated** - instead, use `custom_configuration` to pass `endpoint_url` directly to the Neutron client). Explicit URL for the OpenStack Neutron service. This may be used to override the URL for the Neutron service that is listed in the Keystone service.
* `custom_configuration` A dictionary that enables a custom configuration parameter to be overridden or directly passed to each of the OpenStack clients, by using any of the relevant keys: `keystone_client`, `nova_client`, `neutron_client` or `cinder_client`.
  * Parameters passed directly to OpenStack clients using the `custom_configuration` mechanism override other definitions . For example, any of the common OpenStack configuration parameters listed above, such as `username` and `tenant_name`.
  * Following is an example for the usage of the `custom_configuration` section in a blueprint:
{{< gsHighlight  yaml  >}}
custom_configuration:
  nova_client:
    bypass_url: nova-endpoint-url
    nova_specific_key_1: value_1
    nova_specific_key_2: value_2
  neutron_client:
    endpoint_url: neutron-endpoint-url
  keystone_client:
    ..
  cinder_client:
    ..

# Types

## cloudify.openstack.nodes.Server

**Derived From:** cloudify.nodes.Compute

**Properties:**

  * `server` Key-value server configuration as described in the [OpenStack compute create server API](http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref-compute-v2.html#compute_servers). (**Deprecated** - Use the `args` input in create operation instead.)
  * `image` The image for the server. Can receive either the ID or the name of the image. <br>*Note*: This property is currently optional for backwards-compatibility, but will be modified to become a required property in future versions (Default: `''`).
  * `flavor` The flavor for the server. Can receive either the ID or the name of the flavor. <br>*Note*: This property is currently optional for backwards-compatibility, but will be modified to become a required property in future versions (Default: `''`).
  * `management_network_name` Cloudify management network name. Every server must be connected to the management network. If the management network's name information is available in the Provider Context, the connection is made automatically and there is no need to override the property. (See the [Misc section](#misc) for more information about the OpenStack Provider Context). Otherwise, you must set the value of this property to the management network name, as specified in the bootstrap process. <br>*Note*: When using Nova-net OpenStack (see the [Nova-net Support section](#nova-net-support)), do not specify this property. Defaults to `''` (empty string).
  * `use_password` A boolean describing whether this server image supports user-password authentication. Images that do support user-password authentications should post the administrator user's password to the OpenStack metadata service (for example, via [cloudbase](http://www.cloudbase.it/cloud-init-for-windows-instances/)). The password would then be retrieved by the plugin, decrypted using the server's keypair, then saved in the server's runtime properties.  Defaults to `false`.
  * `use_external_resource` A boolean for setting whether to create the resource or use an existing one. See the [Using Existing Resources section](#using-existing-resources). Defaults to `false`.
  * `resource_id` The name to assign to the new resource, or the name or ID of an existing resource when the `use_external_resource` property is set to `true`. (See the [Using Existing Resources section](#using-existing-resources)). Defaults to `''` (empty string).
  * `openstack_config` See the [OpenStack Configuration](#openstack-configuration). (**Deprecated** - Use the `openstack_config` input in all the operations instead.)

**Mapped Operations:**

  * `cloudify.interfaces.lifecycle.create` Creates the server.
    * **Inputs:**
      * `args` Key-value server configuration as described in the [OpenStack compute create server API](http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref-compute-v2.html#compute_servers).
        * **Notes:**
          * Avoid using the `nics` key. To connect the server to networks, connect the server node should be connected to network nodes and/or port nodes via relationships. These will be translated into the appropriate `nics` definitions automatically.
          * The public key that is set for the server must match the private key file that has its path set for the `cloudify_agent`'s `key` property (see cloudify.nodes.Compute's properties). The public key can be set in a number of ways:
            * By connecting the server node to a keypair node using the `cloudify.openstack.server_connected_to_keypair` relationship.
            * By setting the public key explicitly in the `key_name` key under the `server` property. See [Misc section](#misc)).
            * If the agent's keypair information is set in the provider context, the agents' keypair serves as the default public key to be used, if it was not specified otherwise. See the [Misc section](#misc) for more information about the OpenStack Provider Context.
          * If the server is to have an agent installed on it, it must use the agents security group. If the agents security group information is not set in the provider context, the group should be set using the `security_groups` key. See the [Misc section](#misc) for more information on the OpenStack provider context.
        * **Sugaring:**
          * `image_name` (**Deprecated** - Use the `image` *property* instead.) will automatically resolve the OpenStack name of an image into its matching image ID.
          * `flavor_name` (**Deprecated** - Use the `flavor` *property* instead.) will automatically resolve the OpenStack name of a flavor into its matching flavor ID.
          * the `userdata` key can receive either a string (passed as-is to Nova in the create server request), or a dictionary containing:
            * A field `type` with the value `http`
            * A field `url` with a value that is a URL to a `userdata` script/value.
      * `openstack_config` See the [OpenStack Configuration](#openstack-configuration).
  * `cloudify.interfaces.lifecycle.start` Starts the server if it is not already started.
    * **Inputs:**
      * `start_retry_interval` Polling interval until the server becomes active, in seconds. (Default: `30`)
      * `private_key_path` Path to the private key that matches the server's public key. Used to decrypt the password if the `use_password` property is set to `true`. If not set, the plugin attempts to find a keypair node connected to the server and uses that, or uses the default agent keypair that was set during bootstrap (Default: `''`).
      * `openstack_config` See the [OpenStack Configuration](#openstack-configuration).
  * `cloudify.interfaces.lifecycle.stop` Stops the server if it is not already stopped.
    * **Inputs:**
      * `openstack_config` See the [OpenStack Configuration](#openstack-configuration).
  * `cloudify.interfaces.lifecycle.delete` Deletes the server and waits for termination.
    * **Inputs:**
      * `openstack_config` See the [OpenStack Configuration](#openstack-configuration).
  * `cloudify.interfaces.validation.creation` See the [common validations section](#Validations). In addition, the image and flavor supplied are checked for existence.
    * **Inputs:**
      * `args` Key-value server configuration, as described in the [OpenStack compute create server API](http://docs.openstack.org/api/openstack-compute/2/content/POST_createServer__v2__tenant_id__servers_CreateServers.html). The same as the arguments' input in create operation.
      * `openstack_config` See the [OpenStack Configuration](#openstack-configuration).

**Attributes:**

See the [Common Runtime Properties section](#runtime-properties).

Two additional runtime properties are available on node instances of this type after the `cloudify.interfaces.lifecycle.start` operation succeeds.

  * `networks` The server's networks' information, as retrieved from the Nova service.
  * `ip` The private IP (IP on the internal network) of the server.
  * `password` The administrator user password. This runtime property is only available if the `use_password` property is set to `true`.



## cloudify.openstack.nodes.WindowsServer

**Derived From:** [cloudify.openstack.nodes.Server](#cloudifyopenstackserver)

This type has the same properties and operations mapping as the type above it (because it derives from it). However, it overrides some of the agent and plugin installations operations mapping that is derived from the built-in cloudify.nodes.Compute type. Use this type when working with a Windows server.

In addition, the default value for the `use_password` property is overridden for this type, and is set to `true`. If you are using an image with a preset password, change the value to `false`.



## cloudify.openstack.nodes.KeyPair

    * Validation that the provided private key path does exist and includes the correct permissions and/or owner for an existing key pair resource.
    * **Inputs:**
      * `openstack_config` See the [OpenStack Configuration](#openstack-configuration).

**Attributes:**

See the [common Runtime Properties section](#runtime-properties).



## cloudify.openstack.nodes.Subnet

**Derived From:** cloudify.nodes.Subnet

**Properties:**

  * `subnet` The key-value subnet configuration, as described in the [OpenStack network create subnet API](http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref-networking-v2.html#subnets). (**Deprecated** - Use the `args` input in create operation instead.)
  * `use_external_resource` A boolean for setting whether to create the resource or use an existing one. See the [Using Existing Resources section](#using-existing-resources). Defaults to `false`.
  * `resource_id` The name to assign to the new resource, or the name or ID of an existing resource when the `use_external_resource` property is set to `true`. (Se the [Using Existing Resources section](#using-existing-resources)). Defaults to `''` (empty string).
  * `openstack_config` See the [OpenStack Configuration](#openstack-configuration). (**Deprecated** - Use the `openstack_config` input in all the operations instead.)

**Mapped Operations:**

    * **Inputs:**
      * `args` The key-value `security_group` configuration as described in the [OpenStack network create security group API](http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref-networking-v2-ext.html#createSecGroup). Defaults to `{}`.
        * **Sugaring:**
          * `port` The key can be used instead of the `port_range_max` and `port_range_min` keys to limit the rule to a single port.
          * `remote_group_node` Can be used instead of `remote_group_id` to specify a remote group, by supplying this key with a value that is the name of the remote security group node. The target node must be a node with which the current security-group node has a relationship (of any type). Note that, as with the `remote_group_id` key, this value should not be provided if `remote_ip_prefix` was set.
          * `remote_group_name` Automatically resolves the OpenStack name of a security group into a `remote_group_id`. Note that, as with the `remote_group_id` key, this value should not be provided if `remote_ip_prefix` was set.
      * `openstack_config` See the [OpenStack Configuration](#openstack-configuration).
  * `cloudify.interfaces.lifecycle.delete` Deletes the security group.
    * **Inputs:**
      * `openstack_config` See the [OpenStack Configuration](#openstack-configuration).

  * `router` A key-value router configuration as described in the [OpenStack network create router API](http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref-networking-v2.html#layer3). (**Deprecated** - Use the `args` input in create operation instead.)
  * `external_network` An external network name or ID. If specified, the router uses this external network as a gateway. Defaults to `''` (empty string).
  * `default_to_managers_external_network` A boolean that determines whether to use the Cloudify Manager's external network if no other external network was set (whether by a relationship, by the `external_network` property, or by the nested `external_gateway_info` key in the `router` property). This is only relevant if the Manager's external network appears in the [Provider-context](#misc). Defaults to `true`.
  * `use_external_resource` A boolean for setting whether to create the resource or use an existing one. See the [Using Existing Resources section](#using-existing-resources). Defaults to `false`.

  * `openstack_config` See the [OpenStack Configuration](#openstack-configuration). (**Deprecated** - Use the `openstack_config` input in all the operations instead.)

**Notes:**

  * There are several ways to connect a router to an external network:
    * The most direct way is to use the `external_network` property, which enables you to provide either the name or ID of the external network to which to connect.
    * Another option which may be preferred, especially if there's already a node representing the external network in the blueprint, is to connect the router to the external network using a relationship.
    * You can pass the external network ID via the standard Neutron API by using the nested `network_id` key under the `external_gateway_info` key of the `router` property. This overrides a value specified under the `external_network` property.
    * If none of the above is set, and the external-network used by the Cloudify Manager is available in the [Provider-context](#misc), it may be automatically used as the gateway for the router, depending on the value of the `default_to_managers_external_network` property.
  * Do not provide an external network by both an ID/name *and* by relationship as this causes an error.

**Mapped Operations:**

  * `cloudify.interfaces.lifecycle.create` creates the router
    * **Inputs:**
      * `openstack_config` See the [OpenStack Configuration](#openstack-configuration).
      * `args` The key-value router configuration as described in the [OpenStack network create router API](http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref-networking-v2.html#layer3). Defaults to `{}`.

            * If none of the above is provided, and the external-network used by the Cloudify Manager is available in the [Provider-context](#misc), it can be automatically used as the gateway for the router, depending on the value of the `default_to_managers_external_network` property.

          * Do not provide an external network by both an ID/name *and* by relationship as this causes an error.
  * `cloudify.interfaces.lifecycle.delete` Deletes the router
    * **Inputs:**
      * `openstack_config` See the [OpenStack Configuration](#openstack-configuration).
  * `cloudify.interfaces.validation.creation` See [common validations section](#Validations).

  * `use_external_resource` A boolean for setting whether to create the resource or use an existing one. See the [Using Existing Resources section](#using-existing-resources). Defaults to `false`.
  * `resource_id` The name to assign to the new resource, or the name or ID of an existing resource when the `use_external_resource` property is set to `true`. (See the [Using Existing Resources section](#using-existing-resources)). Defaults to `''` (empty string).

# Relationships

{{% gsInfo title="Information" %}}
Not all relationships have built-in types. For example, some types might simply be connected using standard Cloudify relationships such as `cloudify.relationships.connected_to`.

Some relationships take effect in non-relationship operations. For example, a subnet that is connected to a network is connected on the subnet's creation (in the `cloudify.interfaces.lifecycle.create` operation) and not in a `cloudify.interfaces.relationship_lifecycle.establish` operation. This occurs whenever the connection information is required at resource creation.

**Mapped Operations:**

  * `cloudify.interfaces.relationship_lifecycle.establish` Associates the floating IP with the server.
    * **Inputs:**
      * `fixed_ip` A specific fixed IP of the server to be associated with the floating IP. If omitted, a fixed-IP (or "port") is selected by OpenStack (Default: `''`).

      * `openstack_config` See the [OpenStack Configuration](#openstack-configuration).

## cloudify.openstack.port_connected_to_subnet

# Types' Common Behaviors

## Validations

All types provide the same base functionality for the `cloudify.interfaces.validation.creation` interface operation:

  * If it is a new resource (`use_external_resource` is set to `false`), the basic validation verifies that there is sufficient quota to allocate a new resource of the specified type.

  * When [using an existing resource](#using-existing-resources), the validation verfies that the resource exists.


## Runtime Properties

Node instances of any of the types defined in this plugin are set with the following runtime properties during the `cloudify.interfaces.lifecycle.create` operation:

  * `external_id` The OpenStack ID of the resource
  * `external_type` The OpenStack type of the resource
  * `external_name` The OpenStack name of the resource

The only exceptions are the two *floating IP* types. Because `floating-ip` objects on OpenStack do not have a name, the `external_name` runtime property is replaced with the `floating_ip_address` name, which holds the object's actual IP address.


## Default Resource Naming Convention

When creating a new resource (i.e. `use_external_resource` is set to `false`), its name on OpenStack is the value of its `resource_id` property. However, if this value is not provided, the name defaults to the following schema:

`<openstack-resource-type>_<deployment-id>_<node-instance-id>`

For example, if a server node is defined as follows:

{{< gsHighlight  yaml  >}}
node_templates:
  myserver:
    type: cloudify.openstack.nodes.Server
    ...
{{< /gsHighlight >}}

Without setting the `resource_id` property, the server's name on OpenStack will be `server_my-deployment_myserver_XXXXX` (where the _XXXXX_ is the autogenerated part of the node instance's ID).




# Using Existing Resources

You can use existing resources on OpenStack, regardless of whether they were created by a different Cloudify deployment or not via Cloudify at all.

All Cloudify OpenStack types have a property called `use_external_resource`, which has a default value of `false`. When set to `true`, the plugin applies different semantics for each of the operations executed on the relevant node's instances. Specifically, in the case of the `cloudify.interfaces.lifecycle.create` operation, rather than creating a new resource on OpenStack of the specified type, the plugin behaves as follows:

1. Attempts to locate an existing resource on OpenStack for which the name (or IP, in the case of one of the *floating-ip* types) is the value specified for the `resource_id` property. If more than one is found, an error is generated.

2. If no resource is found, the plugin uses the value of the `resource_id` property to look for the resource by ID. If a resource is still not found, an error is generated.

3. If a single resource is found, the plugin uses that resource and sets the node instance with the appropriate runtime properties, according to the resource's data.


The semantics of other operations are also affected, as follows:

* The `cloudify.interfaces.lifecycle.start` operation, where applicable, only validates that the resource has started, and generates an error if it has not.

* The `cloudify.interfaces.lifecycle.stop` operation, where applicable, does not have any effect.

* The `cloudify.interfaces.lifecycle.delete` operation does not delete the resource from OpenStack, but clears the runtime properties from the node instance.

* The `cloudify.interfaces.validation.creation` operation verifies that a resource with the specified name or ID exists, or prints a list of all available resources of the specific type.

* The `cloudify.interfaces.relationship_lifecycle.establish` operation behaves as normal if the related node is not set with `use_external_resource` as `true`. However, if both nodes have the property set to `true`, the operation only attempts to verify that they are also "connected" on OpenStack. ("Connected" in this case also refers to a `security-group` imposed on a server, a floating IP associated with a server, and so on.)


## Notes

* As mentioned in the [Relationships section](#relationships), some relationships take effect in non-relationship operations. When `use_external_resource` is set to `true`, the existence of such connections is validated as well.

* Using an existing resource is only logical for single-instance nodes.




# Nova-net Support

The OpenStack plugin includes support for Nova-net mode, meaning an OpenStack installation that does not have the Networking API (Neutron service).

In such an environment, there is only a single preconfigured private network that all servers make use of automatically. There are no subnets, networks, routers or ports. Since these resource types do not exist, the plugin's equivalent types are not valid for use in such an environment.

However, there are some resource types for which the API is available via both the Nova and the Neutron services. They had originally been on the Nova service and were later moved and received extended implementation in the Neutron service. They were also retained for backward compatibility in the Nova service.

For these resource types the OpenStack plugin defines two separate types. One type is in the plugin's standard types namespace (`cloudify.openstack.nodes.XXX`) that uses the newer, extended API via the Neutron service. The other type is in a special namespace (`cloudify.openstack.nova_net.nodes.XXX`) that uses the older API via the Nova service. You might therefore notice two separate types defined for [Floating](#cloudifyopenstacknodesfloatingip) [IP](#cloudifyopenstacknovanetnodesfloatingip), and for [Security](#cloudifyopenstacknodessecuritygroup) [Group](#cloudifyopenstacknovanetnodessecuritygroup).


To summarize, ensure that when working in a Nova-net OpenStack environment, Neutron types are not used. These include all types in which the resources' APIs are natively available only via the Network API, and the types that are in the `cloudify.openstack.nova_net.Nodes` namespace.

Conversely, when using an OpenStack environment that supports Neutron, it is recommended that you use the Neutron-versions of the relevant types (meaning that you avoid any types defined under the `cloudify.openstack.nova_net.Nodes` namespace), as they offer more advanced capabilities. However, it's important to mention that this is not required, and using the Nova-versions of some types in a Neutron-enabled environment is possible and will work as well.



# Examples

## Example I: Using plugin types and creating relationships

This example demonstrates how to use most of the types in this plugin, and how to create the relationships between them. It creates a server with a security group set on it and a floating IP associated to it, on a subnet in a network.

**Node by Node Explanation**

1. Creates a floating IP with the node name `my_floating_ip`, and the `Ext-Net` floating_network_name. (This value represents the name of the external network).

2. Creates a network with the node name `my_network`, and the `my_network_openstack_name` name on OpenStack.

3. Creates a subnet with the node name `my_subnet`, and the `my_subnet_openstack_name` name on OpenStack. The subnet's address range is defined as 1.2.3.0 - 1.2.3.255 using the `cidr` parameter, and the subnet's IP version is set to version 4. The subnet will be set on the `my_network_openstack_name` network because of the relationship to the `my_network` node.

4. Creates a security_group with the node name `my_security_group`, and the  `my_security_group_openstack_Name` name on OpenStack. The security group is set with a single rule, that allows all traffic (Because the address range `0.0.0.0/0` is used) to port `8080`. (The default direction is *ingress*).

5. Creates a server with the node name `my_server`, and the `my_server_openstack_name` name on OpenStack. The server is set with an image and flavor IDs. The server is set with multiple relationships:
  - A relationship to the `my_network` node. Through this relationship, the server is automatically placed on the `my_network_openstack_name` network.
  - A relationship to the `my_subnet` node. This relationship is strictly for ensuring the order of creation is correct because the server requires the `my_subnet_openstack_name` subnet to exist before it can be created on it.
  - A relationship to the `my_floating_ip` node. This designated relationship type is responsible for associating the server with the floating IP represented by the `my_floating_ip` node.
  - A relationship with the `my_security_group` node. This relationship is responsible for setting the server up with the security group that is represented by the `my_security_group` node.

## Example II: Using the router and port types

This example demonstrates how to use the `router` and `port` types, and some of the relationships that were not included in example I. It creates a server connected to a port, in which the port is set on a subnet in a network and has a security group set on it. Finally, it shows how this subnet connects to a router and from there to the external network.

**Node by Node Explanation**

1. Creates a network. See example I for more information.

2. Creates a security group. See example I for more information.

3. Creates a subnet. This is similar to that in example I, but in this example the subnet has an additional relationship set towards a router.

4. Creates a port, with the node name `my_port`, and the name `my_port_openstack_name` on OpenStack. The port is set with multiple relationships:
  - A relationship to the `my_network` node. Through this relationship, the port will be automatically placed on the `my_network_openstack_name` network.
  - A relationship to the `my_subnet` node. This relationship is strictly for ensuring the correct order of creation, becaue the port requires that the `my_subnet_openstack_name` subnet exists before it can be created on it.
  - A relationship to the `my_security_group` node. This designated relationship type manages the setting of the `my_security_group_openstack_name` security group on the port.

5. Creates a router, with the node name `my_router` and the `my_router_openstack_name` name on OpenStack. The router will automatically have an interface in the external network.

6. Creates a server, with the node name `my_server`, and the *the node's ID* name (because no `name` parameter was supplied under the `server` property) on OpenStack.<br>
The server is set with an image and flavor IDs. It also overrides the `cloudify_agent` property of its parent type, to set the username that will be used to connect to the server for installing the Cloudify agent on it. Finally, it is set with a relationship to the `my_port` node. This designated relationship type manages connecting the server to `my_port_openstack_name`.

Node by Node Explanation

1. Creates a keypair. The private key is saved under `/tmp/windows-test.pem`.
2. Creates a Windows server.
  * It is set with a relationship to the `my_keypair` node, which makes the server use the it as a public key for authentication, and also makes it use this public key to encrypt the password before posting it to the OpenStack metadata service.
  * The worker-installer interface operations are supplied with values for the user and password for the `cloudify_agent` input. The password uses the [get_attribute]({{< relref "blueprints/spec-intrinsic-functions.md#get-attribute" >}}) feature to retrieve the decrypted password from the Server's runtime properties. (Note that in this example, only the `install` operation was supplied with this input, but all of the worker installer operations and the plugin installer operations should be supplied with it).
  * Custom userdata is defined that configures WinRM and installs Python on the machine (Windows Server 2012 in this example) after it is up. This is required for the Cloudify agent to be installed on the machine.

# Tips

* It is highly recommended that you **ensure that OpenStack names are unique** (for a given type). While OpenStack allows same name objects, having identical names for objects of the same type might lead to ambiguities and errors.

* To set up DNS servers for OpenStack servers (whether Cloudify Manager or application VMs), you can use the OpenStack `dns_nameservers` parameter for the [Subnet type](#cloudifyopenstacknodessubnet), meaning that you can pass the parameter directly to Neutron by using the `args` input of the operations in Subnet node, e.g.:
{{< gsHighlight  yaml  >}}
my_subnet_node:
  interfaces:
    cloudify.interfaces.lifecycle:
      create:
        inputs:
          args:
            dns_nameservers: [1.2.3.4]
    cloudify.interfaces.validation:
      creation:
        inputs:
          args:
            dns_nameservers: [1.2.3.4]
{{< /gsHighlight >}}
  This will set up `1.2.3.4` as the DNS server for all servers on this subnet.

* Public keys, unlike the rest of the OpenStack resources, are user-based rather than tenant-based. When errors indicate a missing keypair, ensure that you are using the correct user rather than tenant.

* ICMP rules appear on Horizon (OpenStack GUI) as ones defined using `type` and `code` fields, rather than a port range. However, in the actual Neutron (and Nova, in case of Nova-net security groups) service, these fields are represented using the standard port range fields (i.e., `type` and `code` correspond to `port_range_min` and `port_range_max` (respectively) on Neutron security groups, and to `from_port` and `to_port` (respectively) on Nova-net security groups).
  * For example, to set a security group rule that enables *ping* from anywhere, the following setting may be declared in the blueprint:
    * `protocol`: `icmp`
    * `port_range_min`: `0` (type)
    * `port_range_max`: `0` (code)
    * `remote_ip_prefix`: `0.0.0.0/0`

* To use OpenStack Neutron's ML2 extensions, use the `args` input for the Network's `create` operation. For example, the [provider network](http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref-networking-v2-ext.html#createProviderNetwork) may be set in the following way:

{{< gsHighlight  yaml  >}}
my_network:
  type: cloudify.openstack.nodes.Network
  ...
  interfaces:
    cloudify.interfaces.lifecycle:
      create:
        inputs:
          args:
            # Note that for this parameter to work, OpenStack must be configured to use Neutron's ML2 extensions
            provider:network_type: vxlan
{{< /gsHighlight >}}

* Ordering NICs in the OpenStack plugin can be done in the 1.4 version of the OpenStack plugin by simply stating the relationships to the various networks (or ports) in the required order, e.g.:
{{< gsHighlight  yaml  >}}
node_templates:
  server:
    type: cloudify.openstack.nodes.Server
    relationships:
      - target: network1
        type: cloudify.relationships.connected_to
      - target: network2
        type: cloudify.relationships.connected_to

  network1:
    type: cloudify.openstack.nodes.Network
    properties:
      resource_id: network1

  network2:
    type: cloudify.openstack.nodes.Network
    properties:
      resource_id: network2
{{< /gsHighlight >}}
  In the example above, network1 is connected to a NIC preceding the one network2 will. However, these will not be eth0/eth1, but rather eth1/eth2 because by default, the management network will be prepended to the networks list (meaning it will be assigned to eth0).
  To avoid this prepending, explicitly declare a relationship to the management network, where the network is represented in the blueprint by an existing resource (using the `use_external_resource` property).
  This will cause the management network to adhere the NICs ordering as the rest of them.
  Example:
{{< gsHighlight  yaml  >}}
node_templates:
  server:
    type: cloudify.openstack.nodes.Server
    properties:
      management_network_name: network2
    relationships:
      - target: network1
        type: cloudify.relationships.connected_to
      - target: network2
        type: cloudify.relationships.connected_to
      - target: network3
        type: cloudify.relationships.connected_to

  network1:
    type: cloudify.openstack.nodes.Network
    properties:
      resource_id: network1

  network2:
    type: cloudify.openstack.nodes.Network
    properties:
      use_external_resource: true
      resource_id: network2

  network3:
    type: cloudify.openstack.nodes.Network
    properties:
      use_external_resource: true
      resource_id: network3
{{< /gsHighlight >}}
  In this example, "network2" represents the management network, however it will be connected to eth1, whereas "network1" will take eth0, and "network3" (which also already existed) will be connected to eth2.
  {{% gsInfo title="Information" %}}
  The server's property `management_network_name: network2` is not mandatory for this to work, it has been added to make the example clear. However, the management network can also be inferred from the provider context (which is what happens when this property is not explicitly set). If the provider context was to have `network2` set as the management network, the example would have worked just the same with this property omitted.
  {{% /gsInfo %}}

# Misc

* The plugin's operations are each *transactional* (and therefore also can be retried on failure), but not *idempotent*. Attempting to execute the same operation twice is likely to fail.

* Throughout this documentation, it has been mentioned multiple times that some configuration-saving information may be available in the Provider Context. The OpenStack Manager blueprint and OpenStack provider both create this relevant information. Therefore, if either was used for bootstrapping, the Provider Context will be available for the OpenStack plugin to use.

  The exact details of the structure of the OpenStack Provider Context are not documented because this feature is being deprecated and will be replaced with a more advanced one.
