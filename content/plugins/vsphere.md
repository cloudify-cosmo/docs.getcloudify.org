# Description

The vSphere plugin allows users to use a vSphere based infrastructure for deploying services and applications.

{{% gsNote %}}
This page relates to a commercial add-on to Cloudify which is not open source. If you'd like to give it a test drive contact us using the feedback button on the right.
The vSphere plugin.yaml configuration file can be found in this [link.]({{< field "plugin_link" >}})

# Plugin Requirements

* Python Versions:
    * 2.7.x

## vSphere Environment

* You will require a working vSphere environment. The plugin was tested with version 5.5, with updates 1 and 2 installed.

## SSH Keys
* You will need SSH keys generated for both the manager and the application VM's. If you are using the default key locations in the inputs, these can be created with the following commands:

{{< gsHighlight  bash  >}}
ssh-keygen -b2048 -N "" -q -f ~/.ssh/cloudify-manager-kp.pem
ssh-keygen -b2048 -N "" -q -f ~/.ssh/cloudify-agent-kp.pem
{{< /gsHighlight >}}

## OS Templates

* You need two OS templates of your preferred operating systems (e.g. Ubuntu Trusty) within the vSphere datastores. One for the Cloudify manager and one for the application VMs. The application VM template should accept the Cloudify agent public key for its root user. The Cloudify manager template must accept the cloudify manager public key. Note that you can choose to use same template for both the manager and the application VMs, in that case the shared template must accept both public keys.
* Both templates must have SSH activated and open on the firewall.
* Both templates must have VMWare tools installed. Instructions for this can be found on the [VMWare site](http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=2075048). Please note, however, that the instructions on this site give incorrect tools for importing keys (it should be using `rpm --import <key>` rather than the apt-key equivalent). After following the instructions you should also run: `chkconfig vmtoolsd on`.
* It is also necessary to install the deployPkg plugin on the VM according to [VMWare documentation](http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=2075048)
* The template should not have any network interfaces.


# Types

{{% gsTip title="Tip" %}}
Each type has property `connection_config`. It can be used to pass parameters for authenticating. Overriding of this property is not required, and by default the authentication will take place with the same credentials that were used for the Cloudify bootstrap process.

## cloudify.vsphere.nodes.server

**Derived From:** [cloudify.nodes.Compute](reference-types.html)

**Properties:**

* `server` key-value server configuration.
    * `name` server name.
    * `template` virtual machine template from which server will be spawned. For more information, see the [Misc section - Virtual machine template](#virtual-machine-template).
    * `cpus` number of CPUs.
    * `memory` amount of RAM, in MB.

* `networking` key-value server networking configuration.
    * `domain` the fully qualified domain name.
    * `dns_servers` list of DNS servers.
    * `connected_networks` list of existing networks to which server will be connected, described as key-value objects. Network will be described as:
        * `name` network name.
        * `management` signifies if it's a management network (false by default). Only one connected network can be management.
        * `external` signifies if it's an external network (false by default). Only one connected network can be external.
        * `switch_distributed` signifies if network is connected to a distributed switch (false by default).
        * `use_dhcp` use DHCP to obtain an ip address (true by default).
        * `network` network cidr (for example, 10.0.0.0/24). It will be used by the plugin only when `use_dhcp` is false.
        * `gateway` network gateway ip. It will be used by the plugin only when `use_dhcp` is false.
        * `ip` server ip address. It will be used by the plugin only when `use_dhcp` is false.

* `connection_config` key-value vSphere environment configuration. If not specified, values that were used for Cloudify bootstrap process will be used.
    * `username` vSphere username.
    * `password` user password.
    * `url` vCenter url.
    * `port` vCenter port for SDK (443 by default).
    * `datacenter_name` datacenter name.
    * `resource_pool_name` name of a resource pool. If you do not with to use a resource pool this must be set to 'Resources' as this is the base resource pool on vSphere.
    * `auto_placement` signifies whether to use vSphere's auto-placement instead of the plugin's. Must be true if you are using clusters. (false by default).


## cloudify.vsphere.nodes.network

**Derived From:** [cloudify.nodes.Network](reference-types.html)

**Properties:**

* `network` key-value network configuration.
    * `name` network name
    * `vlan_id` vLAN identifier which will be assignee to the network.
    * `vswitch_name` vSwitch name to which the network will be connected
* `connection_config` key-value vSphere environment configuration. Same as for `cloudify.vsphere.server` type.


## cloudify.vsphere.nodes.storage

**Derived From:** [cloudify.nodes.Volume](reference-types.html)

**Properties:**

* `storage` key-value storage disk configuration.
    * `storage_size` disk size in GB.
* `connection_config` key-value vSphere environment configuration. Same as for `cloudify.vsphere.server` type.


# Examples

## Example I

This example will show how to use all of the types in this plugin.

{{% gsCloak "Example I" %}}
The following is an excerpt from the blueprint's `blueprint`.`node_templates` section:

example_server:

    networking:

Node by node explanation:

1. Creates a server. In the server 'networking' property we spefied desired domain name as 'example.com', additional DNS server 8.8.8.8, and three existing networks we want to connect to: example_management_network, example_external_network and example_other_network. In the 'server' property we specified server name as example_server, vm template name as example_server_template, number of cpus as 1, and RAM as 512 MB.

2. Creates a network. We specified network name as example_network, network vLAN id as 1, and an existing vSwitch name we want to connect to as example_vswitch.

3. Creates a storage. We specified desired storage size as 1 GB and wish to add this storage to example_server vm.

## Resources prefix support

This plugin supports transformation of resource names according to the resources prefix feature. For more information on this feature, visit the [CLI guide](guide-cli.html).
