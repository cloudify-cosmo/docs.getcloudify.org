# vSphere Plugin Configuration


## Accessing Secrets

 It is recommended that you store your credentials as [secrets]({{< relref "manager/using-secrets.md" >}}). You can do this using the [CLI]({{< relref "cli/secrets.md" >}}).
 Secrets can then be accessed inside your blueprints, as follows:

 {{< gsHighlight  yaml  >}}
 external_network:
    type: cloudify.vsphere.nodes.Network
    properties:
      vsphere_config:  
        username: { get_secret: keystone_username }
        password: { get_secret: keystone_password }
        tenant_name: { get_secret: keystone_tenant_name }
        auth_url: { get_secret: keystone_url }
        region: { get_secret: region }
 {{< /gsHighlight >}}   

## vSphere Environment

* You will require a working vSphere environment. The plugin was tested with version 5.5.

## SSH Keys
* You will need SSH keys generated for both the manager and the application VM's. If you are using the default key locations in the inputs, these can be created with the following commands:

{{< gsHighlight  bash  >}}
ssh-keygen -b2048 -N "" -q -f ~/.ssh/cloudify-manager-kp.pem
ssh-keygen -b2048 -N "" -q -f ~/.ssh/cloudify-agent-kp.pem
{{< /gsHighlight >}}

## OS Templates

* You need two OS templates of your preferred operating systems (e.g. Ubuntu Trusty) within the vSphere datastores. One for the Cloudify manager and one for the application VMs. The application VM template should accept the Cloudify agent public key for its root user. The Cloudify manager template must accept the cloudify manager public key. Note that you can choose to use same template for both the manager and the application VMs, in that case the shared template must accept both public keys.
* Both templates must have SSH activated and open on the firewall.
* Both templates must have VMWare tools installed. Instructions for this can be found on the [VMWare site](http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=2075048). Please note, however, that the instructions on this site give incorrect tools for importing keys (it should be using `rpm --import <key>` rather than the apt-key equivalent). After following the instructions you should also run: `chkconfig vmtoolsd on`.
* It is also necessary to install the deployPkg plugin on the VM according to [VMWare documentation](http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=2075048)
* The template should not have any network interfaces.


# Types

{{% gsTip title="Tip" %}}
Each type has property `connection_config`. It can be used to pass parameters for authenticating. Overriding of this property is not required, and by default the authentication will take place with the same credentials that were used for the Cloudify bootstrap process.

It must not be entirely composed of digits (0-9). It will have a unique suffix appended to it, allowing multiple instances for one node. If the name parameter is not specified, the node name from the blueprint will be used, with the same restrictions applying
    * `template` virtual machine template from which server will be spawned. For more information, see the [Misc section - Virtual machine template](#virtual-machine-template).
    * `cpus` number of CPUs.
    * `memory` amount of RAM, in MB.

        * `name` Name of port group or distributed port group on vSphere.
        * `management` signifies if it's a management network (false by default). Only one connected network can be management. This network will have its IP listed under the runtime property 'ip', but will not otherwise have any impact on the way this interface is configured.
        * `external` signifies if it's an external network (false by default). Only one connected network can be external. This network will be the first network attached to the server and will have its IP listed under the runtime property 'public_ip', but will not otherwise have any impact on the way this interface is configured.
        * `switch_distributed` signifies if network is connected to a distributed switch (false by default).
        * `use_dhcp` use DHCP to obtain an ip address (true by default).
        * `network` network cidr (for example, 10.0.0.0/24). It will be used by the plugin only when `use_dhcp` is false.
        * `gateway` network gateway ip. It will be used by the plugin only when `use_dhcp` is false.
        * `ip` server ip address. It will be used by the plugin only when `use_dhcp` is false.

* `connection_config` key-value vSphere environment configuration. If not specified, values that were used for Cloudify bootstrap process will be used.
    * `username` vSphere username.
    * `password` user password.
    * `host` vCenter host name or IP.
    * `port` vCenter port for SDK (443 by default).
    * `datacenter_name` datacenter name.

    * `auto_placement` signifies whether to use vSphere's auto-placement instead of the plugin's. Must be true if you are using clusters. (false by default).

**Runtime properties:**

* `name` Name of the server on vsphere and in the OS
* `ip` Management IP address of the server (as determined by finding the IP of whichever network is set as management), or the IP of the first attached network on the server (if no management interface is set). This will be null/None if there are no attached networks.
* `public_ip` External IP address of server (as determined by finding the IP of whichever network is set as external), or nothing if there is no network set as external.
* `vsphere_server_id` Internal ID of server on vsphere (e.g. vm-1234)

## cloudify.vsphere.nodes.WindowsServer

**Derived From:** cloudify.nodes.Compute

**Properties:**

* `windows_password` The password to set for the administrator account on the Windows system. If this is not supplied then the value under properties.agent_config.password will be used. If neither are supplied, an error will be raised when running install workflows.

* `windows_timezone` The timezone to set the Windows system to. It will default to 90 (GMT without daylight savings (approximately UTC)). If you wish to set this it must be set to an [appropriate integer value](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms912391%28v=winembedded.11%29.aspx)

* `windows_organization` The organization name to set on the Windows system. It will default to: Organization

* `custom_sysprep` A custom sysprep answers file to use for full customization of Windows. Please note that this should be verified to work beforehand, as any errors will only appear on Windows and will not be visible to the plugin. Please note also that any scripts, etc, which attempt to work on the VM after the custom sysprep must be tolerant of multiple retries, as the plugin cannot detect when the custom sysprep has finished so will provide the server as soon as IPs are assigned (which will be before customization is complete).

* `server` key-value server configuration.
    * `name` server name. Note that this MUST NOT contain any characters other than A-Z, a-z, 0-9, hyphens (-), and underscores (_, which will be converted to hyphens). It must not be entirely composed of digits (0-9). It will be truncated at 8 characters to permit a unique identifier suffix, allowing multiple instances for one node. If the name parameter is not specified, the node name from the blueprint will be used, with the same restrictions applying

Node by node explanation:

1. Creates a server. In the server 'networking' property we specified desired domain name as 'example.com', additional DNS server 8.8.8.8, and three existing networks we want to connect to: example_management_network, example_external_network and example_network. In the 'server' property we specified server name as example_server, vm template name as example_server_template, number of cpus as 1, and RAM as 512 MB.

2. Creates a network. We specified network name as example_network, network vLAN id as 101, and an existing vSwitch name we want to connect to as example_vswitch.

3. Creates a virtual hard disk. We specified desired storage size as 1 GB and wish to add this storage to example_server vm.
