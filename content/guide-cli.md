# Overview

The Cloudify CLI can be used both for managing applications, bootstrapping a manager machine and displaying the status of a running manager.


Managing applications is done via REST calls to the management server. The CLI supports all Cloudify flows, such as creating deployments, executing workflows, retrieving events, etc.


Bootstrapping a manager machine is done with the help of components called *Providers*, which are extensions of the CLI that are used to interact with specific IaaS providers.

The flow when bootstrapping is the same for all providers:

  * First, one has to run the `cfy init -p <provide>` command, which will initialize Cloudify for the specific Provider on the current directory. This will create a file named `.cloudify` (where context data is stored) as well as Provider-specific configuration files in the current directory.
  * Editing the configuation file
  * Running the command `cfy bootstrap`


Alternatively, it's possible to work with an existing management server, by issuing the command `cfy use -t <management_ip>`.


{{% gsNote title="Note" %}}It's highly recommended to initialize and work with the CLI from a designated folder{{% /gsNote %}}

A complete command reference page is available [here](cli-cfy-reference.html).



# Installation

**TODO** (Pypi + package installations)


# Configuration

The CLI's `cfy bootstrap` command uses certain parameters. For the time being, those parameters are defined in the provider-specific configuration file (by convention, *cloudify-config.yaml*).

The configuration is (again, by convention), separated into 2 parts. Provider-specific configuration and Cloudify-specific configuration.
Information on each individual configuration parameter is provided below:

* `cloudify`
	* `resources_prefix` An optional prefix to be added to all resources (and private key files) names. It is recommended for the prefix to end with an underscore or a dash. If not provided, no prefix will be added

	* `server`
	  * `packages`
	    * `components_package_url` The URL for the Cloudify components package. Defaults to the URL for the version which matches the CLI's version.
	    * `core_package_url` The URL for the Cloudify core package. Defaults to the URL for the version which matches the CLI's version.
	    * `ui_package_url` The URL for the Cloudify UI package. If provided with an empty string, the UI won't be installed. Defaults to the URL for the version which matches the CLI's version.
	  * `agents`
	    * `packages`
	      * `ubuntu_agent_url` The URL for the Ubuntu agent package. If provided with an empty string, no package will be downloaded. Defaults to the URL for the version which matches the CLI's version.
	      * `centos_agent_url`: The URL for the CentOS agent package. If provided with an empty string, no package will be downloaded. Defaults to the URL for the version which matches the CLI's version.
	      * `windows_agent_url` The URL for the Windows agent package. If provided with an empty string, no package will be downloaded. Defaults to the URL for the version which matches the CLI's version.
	    * `config`
	      * `min_workers` Celery autoscale parameter - the minimum number of workers on an agent machine. See [Autoscaling](http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/workers.html#autoscaling) (Default: `2`).
	      * `max_workers` Celery autoscale parameter - The maximum number of workers on an agent machine. See [Autoscaling](http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/workers.html#autoscaling) (Default: `5`).
	      * `remote_execution_port` The default port that will be used to run commands on agents (Default: `22`).
	      * `user` The default user that will be used to connect with agent machines. If not provided, then this will have to be specified in the blueprints in the agent node or type properties.
	  * `workflows`
	    * `task_retries` Number of retries for a failing workflow task. -1 means infinite retries (Default: `-1`).
	    * `retry_interval` Minimum wait time (in seconds) in between workflow task retries (Default: `30`).
	  * `bootstrap`
	    * `ssh`
	      * `initial_connectivity_retries` Number of retries for the initial connectivity check with the management server (Default: `25`).
	      * `initial_connectivity_retries_interval` Wait time (in seconds) in between the initial connectivity retries (Default: `5`).
	      * `command_retries` Number of retries for bootstrap commands run via SSH (Default: `3`).
	      * `retries_interval` Wait time (in seconds) in between the command retries (Default: `3`).
	      * `connection_attempts` Number of SSH connection attempts (in a single retry) (Default: `1`).
	      * `socket_timeout` timeout (in seconds) for an SSH connection (Default: `10`).
