## Iterative Blueprint Development Guidelines

A blueprint consists of the following artifacts:

- Main blueprint YAML file. This is the YAML file provided to the "cfy blueprints upload" command.
- Additional YAML file, imported (directly or indirectly) by the main blueprint YAML file via the importÂ statement.
- Resource files, such as scripts, configuration files and so forth.

During the blueprint development lifecycle, often there is a need to:

- Modify blueprint files
- Resume failed executions
- Run arbitrary operations
