## Getting started with Cloudify networking orchestration

This tutorial covers the steps required to setup your cloudify manager and use it to orchestrate the deployment of a network service.  It is accompanied by a complete set of ready examples. and structured in a way that walks the reader through the steps required, discusses and explains about alternative approaches and provides references to the actual code used.
This tutorial, does not replace the cloudify documentation, which provides much greater detail on each topic. For an in-depth understanding of specific topics, learn more at [docs.cloudify.co](https://docs.cloudify.co).

### Objectives

The objectives of this tutorial are to:

1. Get you started with a Cloudify server
1. Analyze a basic network service, and orchestrate it using Cloudify through automation of:
  1. Infrastructure and element provisioning
  1. Service component configuration
  1. Chaining all components into a complete network service
1. Learn orchestration best practices, and get the basic Cloudify knowledge to get you started with your own deployments.

### Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that the person running it has access to Openstack and/or Microsoft Azure, with the ability to allocate network, storage, and compute instances.  Also required is a computer capable of running [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community) that has network access to the selected infrastructure.  Note that the computer can itself be an instance on the target cloud.  The computer/instance requires a minimum of 4GB free RAM, and 5GB of disk storage for the Cloudify Docker container.

### Structure

The guide begins with a description of a network service that will serve as the end goal of the tutorial.  Next it discusses general VNF and service modeling methodology best practices.  Finally, the guide will provide platform specific instructions for applying the methodology by creating an operational service chain using Cloudify.

## Analyze our network service example

In this tutorial we are going to use a simple network service consisting of a load balancer and a firewall. To make it a tad more realistic we will be deploying a simple web server to represent the end of the service chain:

![VNF sketch]( /images/bestpractices/vnf/image2.png )

If we break down how one would typically build such a service the basic steps might be:

1. Set up the relevant networks
1. Provision a firewall and configure its network interfaces and network settings
1. Provision a load balancer and configure basic settings
1. Provision a web server instance, configure it with basic web content
1. Compose the service flow by setting the LB to accept traffic on configurable port, direct it to the firewall, and configure the Firewall to allow web traffic to the web server.

Upon completion of these steps we will have a complete service.

### Network Service Orchestration Design Principles

As implied by the previous section, network service orchestration lends itself well to a layered approach.  The layered approach makes both the comprehension of the overall system easier, and cleanly fits typical operational requirements.  From an orchestration perspective, this means separating concerns that may be dependent on each other, but should be deployed and managed separately.  Like the OSI networking model, each layer uses the layer below.

![Orchestration Layering]( /images/bestpractices/vnf/image20.png )

Each layer constitutes a separate orchestration domain, meaning an independent lifecycle.  In Cloudify terms, this means each layer consists of a blueprint or blueprints that have relationships to other layers, but are independently operated.  
Let’s look at each layer in more detail:

#### Base Network  

This layer is the substrate upon which the VNFs and service components will communicate.  This layer itself may be virtualized, and in the context of cloud native orchestration is quite likely to be.  The base network for a service chain would include the networks that the service VNFs would attach to, potentially along with supporting VNFs (like virtual routers) that are not part of the service itself.  This is the most stable layer, as it serves as the platform upon which many services may be deployed (and undeployed) to over time.

#### Network Functions

This is the VNF layer.  Once the base network is in place, the network functions that comprise the service are deployed.  The VNFs attach and communicate via the base network substrate.  From the VNFs, potentially many services may be composed.

#### Service Components

This layer represents non-VNF service components.  This layer is optional, as a network service can be pure (say a service that provides packet forwarding).  However, many services require non-network elements such as databases, web servers and application servers.  The service components utilize the VNF layer to provide the overall service.

#### Service Chaining

This layer represent service configuration.  This layer provides configurations of the underlying network and non-network services in order to provide a specific service configuration.  Initial configurations as well as updates are managed at this layer, and rendered to the underlying layers as needed.  
  
  

### Cloudify Example Network Service Design 

In Cloudify, network services are modeled using blueprints.  A blueprint is a general purpose model for describing systems.  To model our example network service, a blueprint (or blueprint collection) is created to represent each layer described in the previous section.  Blueprints are composed of nodes which are instances of types.  A type can represent anything we need to model, but in general represents the things to be orchestrated, virtual or otherwise.  For example, a type can represent a network in Azure or in Openstack (or any other infrastructure).  In Cloudify, the types are provided as plugins which you include in your blueprints.  Once the types are included, they can be associated with each other via relationships.

![Service design]( /images/bestpractices/vnf/image6.png )

#### Base Network

Ignoring cloud specific differences, the goal of the base network blueprint is to create

- A LAN/private network to provide connectivity between the firewall and web server.
- A WAN/public network to provide connectivity between the load balancer and the firewall.
- An external network, to connect the user to the load balancer.
These networks, and related items like subnets and ports, are modeled in the base network blueprint using types provided by the plugin specific to your cloud.  The details of this layer are exposed to other layers via the capabilities section of the blueprint, which can contain computed/derived runtime values, and is accessible by dependent blueprints.

![Azure base network blueprint]( /images/bestpractices/vnf/image27.png )

_Azure base network blueprint_

#### Network Functions

For this example, we’ve modeled the VNF layer as a collection of blueprints; one for each VNF   (Fortinet Fortigate and F5 BigIP).  Each of the VNF blueprints uses information from the previously discussed base network by access it’s defined capabilities.  This not only isolates the VNF layer from the lifecycle of the base network, but also permits the VNF layer to consume the base network without being bound to its implementation.

![F5 BigIP blueprint]( /images/bestpractices/vnf/image31.png )

_F5 BigIP blueprint_

#### Service Components

This layer is very simple in our example, and consists of a Python web server.  It’s purpose is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the next layer, Service Chaining.  The service chain deployment will expose the web server by configuring the previously deployed VNFs (firewall and load balancer).

#### Service Chaining

The final layer is a service chain implemented as a blueprint.  This blueprint uses the exposed capabilities of the VNF blueprints to configure a network path that exposes the HTTPD server.  This blueprint represents the configuration of the VNFs as separate nodes, and applies the configuration to the existing VNFs using their exposed capabilities and blueprint inputs.  Note that there are different service chain blueprints for each platform, however the service chain is independent of the platform.  This will be fixed in a future release.

## System & Platform setup

The remainder of the tutorial is a guide to constructing the service chain outlined above.

### Available Resources

This tutorial is accompanied by the following resources.

##### Azure VNF Images

The Azure VNF images are located in the Azure marketplace.  The default inputs in the blueprints are sufficient to access them.

##### Openstack VNF Images

- F5 BigIP (account on http://downloads.f5.com required).  The QCOW image is available [here](https://downloads.f5.com/esd/serveDownload.jsp?path=/big-ip/big-ip_v15.x/15.0.0/english/virtual-edition/&sw=BIG-IP&pro=big-ip_v15.x&ver=15.0.0&container=Virtual-Edition&file=BIGIP-15.0.0-0.0.39.ALL_1SLOT.qcow2.zip). Note that you will need to get a license file to complete the process.
- Fortigate - (account on https://support.fortinet.com needed).  The QCOW image is available [here](https://support.fortinet.com/Download/VMImages.aspx) (tested with version 6.0.4).  Note that you will need to get a license file to complete the process.


### Cloudify Manager Deployment

The Cloudify manager is available in multiple formats ranging from Docker to RPM. In this tutorial we will be using the Docker option and assume that Docker is deployed on your local computer.
To learn more about Cloudify manager deployment go to: Cloudify-Getting-Started (https://cloudify.co/getting-started-enterprise/).

Open your terminal and create/start the Docker container:

```
docker run --name cfy_manager_local -d --restart unless-stopped -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro --tmpfs /run --tmpfs /run/lock --security-opt seccomp:unconfined --cap-add SYS_ADMIN -p 80:80 -p 8000:8000 cloudifyplatform/premium
```

Note that, depending on your user privileges, you may need to prefix the above command with ‘sudo’.  If port 80 is unavailable on your host, start the manager with something like ‘-p 8080:80’ rather than ‘-p 80:80’, to make the manager available on a different port.

 To access the Cloudify manager console, go to http://127.0.0.1 (or http://127.0.0.1:<port>)  in your browser. In the login page, type ‘admin’ for both the login and the password.  

Activate your manager by applying your Cloudify license [This step is required for Cloudify Premium version 4.6 or later].  The license can be applied via the Cloudify manager console or via the command line. See the Cloudify wiki for instructions: https://docs.cloudify.co/latest/install_maintain/installation/manager-license/.

To verify server health from the command line, run `docker exec -it cfy_manager_local cfy status`.  This should produce the following output (as of version 4.5.5):

![Manager services]( /images/bestpractices/vnf/image14.png )

### Plugin Installation

Cloudify has an extendable architecture that uses the concept of plugins for orchestration.  Some plugins are built in, and others must be installed based on what platform and components are being orchestrated.

*Learn more about [plugins](https://docs.cloudify.co/latest/working_with/official_plugins/) and [writing plugins](https://docs.cloudify.co/latest/developer/writing_plugins/).*

To install the plugins necessary plugins using the Cloudify CLI, run the following command from the command line:

```
docker exec -i cfy_manager_local cfy plugins bundle-upload
```

Uploading the plugins takes a few minutes.

### Platform API connection parameters

Leveraging Openstack requires access credentials. It is a good practice to keep these credentials as ‘secrets’ in the cloudify manager, allowing different deployments to use them without the need to re-mention in every deployment, or exposing them in blueprints.

#### Openstack API credentials

If using Openstack, you’ll need to create secrets on the manager prior to running the example blueprints  If using Azure, skip down to the section following this one. 
[Learn more about secrets…](https://docs.cloudify.co/latest/working_with/manager/using-secrets/)

In your OpenStack manager browse to: Compute >> Access&Security >>API Access. Click the ‘Download OpenStack RC file’ option. 
![OpenStack RC]( /images/bestpractices/vnf/image8.png )


Then copy this file to the Docker container like so:

```
docker cp <your rc filename> cfy_manager_local:env
```

Then run the following commands to upload the secrets:

```
docker exec -i cfy_manager_local curl -O https://docs.cloudify.co/latest/scripts/upload-secrets.sh
```

```
docker exec -i cfy_manager_local sh upload-secrets.sh
```

As before, you may need to prefix the commands with ‘sudo’, depending on your account permissions.  You will be prompted to enter your Openstack secret during the process.

#### Azure API credentials

To use Azure you’ll need to create secrets containing API credentials on the manager so the blueprints can use them.

- azure_client_id: Service Principal appId. You can set this up via the CLI: `docker exec -i cfy_manager_local cfy secrets create azure_client_id -s [secret value]`.
- azure_client_secret: Service Principal password. You can set this up via the CLI: `docker exec -i cfy_manager_local cfy secrets create azure_client_secret -s [secret value]`.
- azure_subscription_id: Service Principal ID. You can set this up via the CLI: `docker exec -i cfy_manager_local cfy secrets create azure_subscription_id -s [secret value]`.
- azure_tenant_id: Service Principal tenant. You can set this up via the CLI: `docker exec -i cfy_manager_local cfy secrets create azure_tenant_id -s [secret value]`.
- azure_location: Specifies the supported Azure location for the resource. You can set this up via the CLI: `docker exec -i cfy_manager_local cfy secrets create azure_location -s [secret value]`.
- agent_key_private: The content of an RSA private key. (E.g. You can upload this key from a file: `docker exec -i cfy_manager_local cfy secrets create agent_key_private -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa`).
- agent_key_public: The content of an RSA public key. (E.g. You can upload this key from a file: `docker exec -i cfy_manager_local cfy secrets create agent_key_private -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`).

## Provision the service components

### Provisioning the base network

The key prerequisite for a VNF deployment is typically a network or more likely a set of related networks.  This represents the “base network” layer in the design principles.  In our example the Firewall is connected to 3 networks: Management network, WAN and LAN. and we will make sure we set all 3 up before provisioning the VNFs (network function layer).

![BaseNetwork]( /images/bestpractices/vnf/image3.png )


#### Upload the base network blueprint

Using the Cloudify manager UI from the “Local Blueprints” page, select the “Upload” button.

![Upload base blueprint]( /images/bestpractices/vnf/image1.png )


This will display the “Upload blueprint” dialog.  Fill the fields in as follows:

- Blueprint package: https://github.com/cloudify-community/blueprint-examples/releases/download/4.5.5-7/commercial-vnf-network-topology.zip
- Blueprint name: service-base-network
- Blueprint YAML file:
  - If using Openstack: openstack.yaml
  - If using Azure: azure.yaml

Once these fields have been entered, press the “Upload” button to copy the blueprint to the Cloudify server.


#### Create the base network deployment

Uploading the blueprint placed it in the Cloudify local repository on the Cloudify server.  In order to run workflows ( e.g. “install” ) on the blueprint, you must create a deployment, which represents the blueprint and any input parameters.  From the “Local blueprints” page on the Cloudify UI, click the rocket ship icon on the “service-base-network” blueprint line:

![Deploy]( /images/bestpractices/vnf/image7.png )


This will display the “Create deployment” dialog box.  It is here that the blueprint parameters are entered.  Make the following entries:

- Deployment name: service-base-network.
- If using Openstack:
  - External_network_name: the name of the Openstack tenant network that provides internet access ( often something like ‘Ext-net’).

If you are unsure about the external network name, look at the network details for the attribute “external: true”, in the Horizon networks page:

![External network]( /images/bestpractices/vnf/image15.png )


Click the deploy button.  This will kick off the deployment creation, and we are ready to install the network.
If you are using Azure, the defaults in the blueprint are sufficient.

#### Create the base network

From the “Deployments” page in the Cloudify manager UI, select the “install” workflow from the right dropdown hamburger menu on the ‘service-base-network’ deployment.

![Install]( /images/bestpractices/vnf/image24.png )

## Conclusion

Through the series of blueprint installations a service chain of connected network services (Load Balancer, Firewall and Web Server) has been created. In this case service chaining consists of a port forwarding rule on Fortigate and load balancing rule on BIG IP in order to pass traffic through.  While technically possible to orchestrate the various solution components in many ways, the layered approach is a best practice because it provides:

- Isolation - the layers represent domains of orchestration with a common lifecycle
- Abstraction - lower layers can be abstracted from higher layers, increasing reusability
- Granularity - each blueprint represents an orchestration specialty that can be versioned and evolved independently by different teams.
