# {{< param product_name >}} Solution for the VMware stack
{{< param product_name >}}'s integration with the VMware infrastructure is consistent with all other {{< param product_name >}} cloud infrastructure environments. It is aimed not just as a means to automate the VMware environment resources (such as vSphere, vCloud, NSX-T)  but also to manage it in a consistent way with other cloud infrastructure supported by {{< param product_name >}}.

 To achieve this, {{< param product_name >}} provides the following features and interfaces:
 
 
* [vSphere plugin]({{< relref "/working_with/official_plugins/Infrastructure/vsphere.md" >}}) - maps the vSphere API into the {{< param product_name >}} DSL.
* [vCloud plugin]({{< relref "/working_with/official_plugins/Infrastructure/vcloud.md" >}}) - maps the vCLoud API into the {{< param product_name >}} DSL.
* [NSX-T plugin]({{< relref "/working_with/official_plugins/Infrastructure/nsx-t.md" >}}) - maps the NSX-T API into the {{< param product_name >}} DSL.
* [REST Plugin]({{< relref "/working_with/official_plugins/Utilities/rest.md" >}}) - provides generic mapping support to other services such as VRO, vRA, etc. through their REST API.
* [Blueprints]({{< relref "/working_with/console/pages/blueprints-page.md" >}}) and [Plugins]({{< relref "/working_with/console/pages/plugins-page.md" >}}) Marketplace - Enable simple and open provisioning of pre templatized services (similar to VRA).
* [Self Service Portal]({{< relref "/working_with/console/customization/_index.md" >}}) -  Provide a fully open and customizable portal framework that includes white-labeling (logo, skin), Custom Widgets, JavaScript library, back-end support based on {{< param product_name >}} clustering, security, user management, and RBAC.

Combined with the rest of the [{{< param product_name >}} Plugins]({{< relref "/working_with/official_plugins/_index.md" >}}) it allows users to unlock their VMware environment and provide simple integration with the best of breed DevOps and cloud-native ecosystem.
