This section describes the different concepts involved in scaling components of your application blueprint.

Multiple instances and scaling, refers to the number of node instances each node template will have on deployment,
and changes made to that number during run-time after the deployment is created, using the `scale` workflow.

There are two ways of specifying this configuration in an application blueprint. The first relates to configuring the number of node instances on a per-node template basis, using the `scalable` capability configuration. The second method primarliy relates to configuring the number of node instances on a group basis, in which the group contains several node templates.

These concepts are described in the following explanations and examples, including the difference between these two methods,
and how the number of instances for different nodes may be changed during runtime.

## Node Templates `scalable` Configuration
To specify the initial number of instances a node template will have, the node template `capabilities.scalable` properties must be configured.

For example, to configure a VM node template so that it will be deployed with fivew initial instances, the following configuration can be used:

{{< gsHighlight yaml >}}
node_templates:
  example_vm:
    type: cloudify.nodes.Compute
    capabilities:
      scalable:
        properties:
          default_instances: 5
{{< /gsHighlight >}}

See [Node Templates]({{< relref "blueprints/spec-node-templates.md" >}}#capabilities-scalable-configuration) for additional details.

## Scaling Policy and Scaling Groups Configuration
To specify the initial number of instances a *group* of node templates will have as a single unit, use scaling policies and groups.

For example, to configure a scaling group for a VM and an IP, the following configuration can be used:

{{< gsHighlight yaml >}}
node_templates:
  vm:
    type: cloudify.nodes.Compute
  ip:
    type: cloudify.nodes.VirtualIP

groups:
  vm_and_ip:
    members: [vm, ip]

policies:
  scale_policy1:
    type: cloudify.policies.scaling
    properties:
      default_instances: 5
    targets: [vm_and_ip]
{{< /gsHighlight >}}

When deployed, five `vm` node instances and five `ip` node instances will be created.

See [Policies]({{< relref "blueprints/spec-policies.md" >}}) for additional details.

### Combining Node Template `scalable` With Scaling Groups

A node template can have have its `scalable` capability configured and can also be included in a scaling group. For example:

{{< gsHighlight yaml >}}
node_templates:
  vm:
    type: cloudify.nodes.Compute
    capabilities:
      scalable:
        properties:
          default_instances: 3

groups:
  vm_group:
    members: [vm]

policies:
  scale_policy1:
    type: cloudify.policies.scaling
    properties:
      default_instances: 5
    targets: [vm_group]
{{< /gsHighlight >}}

When deployed, 15 (`3 * 5`) `vm` node instances are created.

* You can nest scaling groups, meaning that a scaling group can have another scaling group as one of its members.

* Between members of the same scaling group, using the [`get_attribute` intrinsic function]({{< relref "blueprints/spec-intrinsic-functions.md" >}}#get-attribute) in the blueprint, with explicit reference to a node by its name (i.e. not `SELF`, `SOURCE` or `TARGET`) can be used in places where otherwise, an ambiguity would exist. See [`get_attribute` intrinsic function]({{< relref "blueprints/spec-intrinsic-functions.md" >}}#get-attribute-between-members-of-shared-scaling-groups) for
additional details.

## `connected_to/depends_on` Relationship Semantics
This section describes how `connected_to/depends_on` relationships behave between node instances that belong to the same scaling group instance.

Generally, when two node templates are related via a `connected_to/depends_on` relationship, relationship instances exist from *all* node instances of the source node to *all* node instances of the target node. For more information, see  [the `all_to_all` example]({{< relref "blueprints/spec-relationships.md" >}}#multi-instance-cloudify-relationships-connected-to-semantics).

Similar logic applies between node templates that belong to the same scaling group. The exception is that the relationship instances between the node instances do not "escape" scaling group boundaries, as shown in the following example.

{{< gsHighlight yaml >}}
node_templates:
  application:
    type: web_app
    capabilities:
      scalable:
        properties:
          default_instances: 2
    relationships:
      - type: cloudify.relationships.connected_to
        target: database
  database:
    type: database
    capabilities:
      scalable:
        properties:
          default_instances: 2

groups:
  application_and_database:
    members: [application, database]

policies:
  scale_policy2:
    type: cloudify.policies.scaling
    properties:
      default_instances: 2
    targets: [application_and_database]
{{< /gsHighlight >}}

When the above blueprint snippet is deployed, there are two instances of the `application_and_database` scaling group. Each scaling group contains two node instances of the `application` node and two node instances of the `database` node.

The following diagram shows how the different node instances are connected. Specifically, shows how `connected_to` relationships do not "escape" scaling group boundaries.

The following diagram builds upon the blueprint previously provided, in which there are five `vm_and_ip` scaling group instances with a `vm` and `ip` node instance in each scaling group instance.
If the `vm` node was to have a `connected_to` relationship to the `ip` node, the relationships would behave as shown in the diagram.

## `contained_in` Relationship Semantics

### Implicit Scaling Group Membership

If node `A` is `contained_in` node `B` and node `B` is part of scaling group `S`, then node `A` is also implicitly included in `S`.

For example, in the following example in which a `db` node template is `contained_in` a `vm` node template, both group definitions are equivalent:

{{< gsHighlight yaml >}}
node_templates:
  vm:
    type: cloudify.nodes.Compute
  db:
    type: cloudify.nodes.DBMS
    relationships:
      - target: vm
        type: cloudify.relationships.contained_in

groups:
  vm_group:
    members: [vm, db]

  # is equivalent to
  vm_group:
    members: [vm]

policies:
  scale_policy1:
    type: cloudify.policies.scaling
    targets: [vm_grop]
{{< /gsHighlight >}}

### Scaling groups and `contained_in` Semantics.
The semantics for `contained_in` relationships are described in detail [here]({{< relref "blueprints/spec-relationships.md" >}}#the-cloudify-relationships-contained-in-relationship-type).

Building on those semantics, the following example describes how a scaling group fits in.

{{< gsHighlight yaml >}}
node_templates:
  vm:
    type: cloudify.nodes.Compute
    capabilities:
      scalable:
        properties:
          default_instances: 2
  app:
    type: web_app
    relationships:
      - type: cloudify.relationships.contained_in
        target: vm
  db:
    type: database
    relationships:
      - type: cloudify.relationships.contained_in
        target: vm

groups:
  app_and_db:
    members: [app, db]

policies:
  scale_policy2:
    type: cloudify.policies.scaling
    properties:
      default_instances: 2
    targets: [app_and_db]
{{< /gsHighlight >}}

Deploying the previous blueprint produces the following topology.

<br/>

![scaling_groups_diagram3]({{< img "guide/scaling-groups3.png" >}})

<br/>

You can see in the diagram that two `vm` node instances are deployed, as expected from the blueprint definition.
Each `vm` node instance has two `db` and two `app` node instances contained in it. In other words, each `vm` node instance "contains" two instances of the `app_and_db` scaling group, as defined in the blueprint.

This shows that scaling groups can be "contained in" node templates when their members are `contained_in` some other node templates.

## Scale Workflow
To change the number of node instances during run-time (i.e. after the deployment is installed), use the `scale` workflow.

See [Scale Workflow]({{< relref "workflows/built-in-workflows.md" >}}#the-scale-workflow) for additional details.
